<i>San Francisco, June, 1868</i>.</p>

<p>The Academy, desirous of increasing its numbers, and thus adding to its means
of scientific research and diffusion of knowledge, has this year altered its title to
that of “<span class="smcap">California Academy of Sciences</span>,” and invites all interested in the
increase and spread of any branch of knowledge to join in its work. All gentlemen
residing within one hundred and fifty miles of San Francisco are, by the new
Constitution, eligible to resident membership, with all the privileges of those in the
city, including free copies of the proceedings published after their election.</p>

<p>A copy of the new Constitution, Annual Address of the late President, Prof. J.
D. Whitney, and list of members at the commencement of 1868, may be obtained
free by addressing the Corresponding Secretary.</p>

<p>Meetings are now held on the first and third Mondays of each month, at the
rooms of the Academy, where lectures are given, papers read and discussions held
on scientific subjects. All desiring to become members may be introduced at the
meetings on application to the officers and members.</p>

<p>Rooms open daily, from 12 to 1 o’clock, and the Librarian or other members
are usually present.</p>

NATURAL SCIENCES.</h1>

<hr />

<h2><span class="smcap">Annual Meeting, January 5th, 1863.</span></h2>

<p class="center">President in the Chair.</p>

<p>Twelve members present.</p>

<p>Ferdinand, Freiherr von Richthofen, was elected Corresponding
Member.</p>

<p>The committee on the meteoric iron, presented to the city by
General Carleton, reported that permission had been obtained by
Professor Whitney to saw a piece from it for analysis, and for distribution
to some of the most important collections in this country
and in Europe. A piece will be forwarded to Professor Brush, of
Yale College, for analysis, and a description of the mass published
in the Proceedings of the Academy, as soon as the returns of the
analysis have been received.</p>

<p>The Annual Reports of the officers of the Society for the past
year (1862) were received, and the following is an abstract of
their contents:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The Report of the Treasurer was read, and referred to the
Finance Committee.</p>

<p>The Curator of Palæontology reported, that the number of specimens
in the collection is 1,007, exclusive of numerous duplicates.
They are principally from the cretaceous and tertiary formations of
the Pacific coast. The collection has been rearranged in the
course of the past year, and is now in as good condition as the
accommodations of the Society will admit.</p>

<p>The Curator of Botany reported, that 2,160 specimens were
added to the collection during the year 1862, making a total of
6,160 specimens in the Academy’s herbarium. About twenty new
specimens have been described in the Proceedings during the past
year, and specimens and drawings of all of them have been placed
in the collection. The herbarium is in good condition.</p>

<p>The Curator of Entomology made a verbal report, to the effect
that the collections in his department, although small, are in good
order; but that few additions had been made during the year.</p>

<p>In the Zoological department, the Curator stated, that a few
valuable additions had been made to the collection during the year
1862; but that much difficulty was experienced in arranging them,
from the limited space and means of the Academy. The alcoholic
specimens have not been rearranged during the year; some are in
bad condition. All has been done which could be, towards preserving
the specimens in this department, with the means at the
command of the Curator.</p>

<p>In the absence of the Curator of Conchology (Dr. Trask) it
was stated, that the collection of shells had been arranged, and
labeled, and placed in cases during the year; the accommodations
of the Academy, however, do not admit of their being displayed.</p>

<p>The Curator of Mineralogy (Mr. Hanks) has removed from the
city since the last annual meeting; but previous to removing, he
had made considerable progress in rearranging and labeling the
collection of minerals and ores, and it is now in better order than it
has ever before been.</p>

<p>The Librarian reported that valuable additions had been made
to the Library during the past year; chiefly through the instrumentality
of the Smithsonian Institution. The books are in good
order; but many of them need binding, and the want of room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
renders it impossible to place them where they can be easily got at
by the members.</p>

<p>The committee on nominations reported the following list of
officers for the year 1863, which was duly elected:</p>

<p>Donations to the Cabinet were received as follows:</p>

<p>By Dr. Cooper—Specimens of <i>Purpura septentrionalis</i>, from
San Francisco, and others from Oakland, of larger size—the latter
not being natives of this Bay, but brought from Shoalwater Bay,
W. T., in cargoes of oysters.</p>

<p>By Mr. Bloomer—A collection of specimens of wood.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper exhibited a specimen of coral, of the genus <i>Porites</i>,
probably an undescribed species. This mass of coral was drawn up
by a fisherman, from a depth of four fathoms, at the Farallones, and
deposited in the office of the Geological Survey by Mr. Lawson, of
the Coast Survey. The same species had been previously obtained
by Dr. Cooper in the Bay of Monterey, but it had never been found
so far north before.</p>

<h3>On the Inaccuracy of the Eighth Census, so far as it Relates
to the Metallic and Mineral Statistics of the United States.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. D. WHITNEY.</p>

<p>It has, for a long time, been a subject of regret, that our United States Census
returns are so imperfect; and that, in all that relates to mining and
metallurgy, they are especially and extraordinarily unreliable. Mr. Kennedy’s
“Preliminary Report on the Eighth Census,” (1860), recently issued, is at hand,
and some remarks may here be made in reference to what appears in it, which
is connected with our mineral interests. It will soon appear, from an examination
of this public document, that the same unfortunate ignorance in regard to
one of the most important of the sources of our national wealth, which has
characterized previous Census Reports, still prevails among our officials at
Washington; and that all which Mr. Kennedy’s Report contains must be taken
with many grains of allowance. It is certainly the duty of those who are better
posted to give notice of these deficiencies, and to call public attention to them
again and again, in the hope that something may be done, hereafter, to make
this department of the Government less ridiculous in the eyes of those who are
acquainted with such matters, and less liable to mislead those who look on a
Census Report as something to be blindly quoted, and relied on as a document
which must necessarily be correct.</p>

<p>The only metals in regard to which anything is stated in Mr. Kennedy’s
report are iron, nickel, lead, zinc, and copper; thus omitting gold, silver, and
quicksilver, of each of which we are large producers. Of the mineral productions,
coal is the only one noticed.</p>

<p>The first metal mentioned in the text accompanying the tables compiled from
the Census returns is iron, and the quantity of pig iron produced in 1860 is
given at 884,474 tuns, valued at $19,487,790, and this is stated to be an
increase in the value returned by the Census of 1850, of 44·4 per cent.</p>

<p>Here the question arises, how far are these figures to be relied on as accurate?
This can only be decided by comparison with returns known to be approximately
accurate, and of these we have none later than the year 1856, in which
year the make of pig iron was ascertained, by the Iron-Makers’ Association, to
be 812,917 tuns. Either the Census returns of 1860 are too low, as they were
in 1850, or else the increase in this branch of our industry has been very slight
since 1849, when the make of iron was ascertained by the Pennsylvania
Iron-Masters to be 800,000 tuns. On the other hand, assuming the Census
returns of 1860 to be correct, there is no ground for making the statement, as is
done by Mr. Kennedy, that there has been an increase of 44·4 per cent. in the
value of the iron produced in 1860 over that of 1850; it is evident that the
increase has been very slight, since 1846 or 1847 even, in which years the make
of this metal, on reliable authority, reached nearly 800,000 tuns.</p>

<p>But what shall we say of Mr. Kennedy’s method of arriving at the production
of iron, as related to the amount of population in the United States, or the
number of pounds produced per head? To obtain this, he adds together the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
amount of pig iron and the amount of bar and other wrought iron produced,
and thus obtains a result of 92 pounds of iron produced for each inhabitant of
the United States; which, as he says, “speaks volumes for the progress of the
nation in all its industrial and material interests.” It speaks a volume or two
for his own ignorance of the elements of metallurgy; since, as everybody, except
the Superintendent of the United States Census, knows, the bar and rolled iron
is nearly all converted from the pig, and only a small proportion made direct
from the ore; so that his method of computation is as near correct as it would
be, for instance, to estimate the amount of beef consumed per head in San
Francisco, by adding the weight of all the cattle slaughtered in the city to that
of the beef produced by said slaughtering. As, in 1856, only 28,433 tuns of
bar iron were made directly from the ore, to 812,917 of pig produced; so, allowing
that 28,000 tuns were made direct in 1860, the amount, per head, of all the
iron made in that year would be 65 pounds, instead of 92, as Mr. Kennedy calculates.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Taking the population of the United States at 23,000,000, in 1850,
and the make of iron at 800,000 tuns, as given by the returns of the Commission
of the Iron-Masters of Pennsylvania, the amount produced, per head, in
that year, would be 78 pounds; so that all Mr. Kennedy’s glorification goes
for naught, unless we admit that his returns for 1860 are wrong.</p>

<p>In regard to the statistics of the other metals mentioned in the Census Report,
it may be said, with truth, that they are very defective. No mention is made
of gold, silver, or mercury, the value of the first-named of which produced in
this country is nearly double that of all the other metals. Under zinc, there is
no mention made of New Jersey, the great zinc-producing State. The yield of
lead in the Mississippi Valley is put down at considerably less than its real
amount.</p>

<p>But the most important remark to be made, in this connection, is in reference
to the mode of reporting the results adopted by Mr. Kennedy. Instead of
giving the amount of <i>metal</i> produced, the number of tuns of <i>ore</i> is stated, and
no clue given to the yield of the ore. This is something as an assessor’s report
would be, which should give the valuation of the individuals he might be called
on to appraise, in <i>pieces of money</i>, leaving it uncertain whether five cent or
twenty dollar pieces were intended.</p>

<p>The table given by Mr. Kennedy does not state what amounts of each metal
are produced; and, if we attempt to arrive at them by examining the columns
of values, it is found to be impossible to decide whether these values are those
of the ore as mined before being smelted, or of the metals produced from them.
In short, the whole matter is left in such obscurity, that it is much to be wished
that the table could be expunged from the Report, as it can only serve to mislead
and confuse those who resort to Government documents for information in
regard to our metallic and mineral productions.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In point of fact, the amount of bar iron made in the bloomery furnaces direct from

<p>Dr. Cooper remarked that, since the publication of his paper on
Californian Mollusca, read before the Academy November 3d, 1862,
(see Proceedings, vol. II, p. 202) he finds the generic name
<span class="smcap">Strategus</span> preoccupied, and he now proposes, in its place, the
name <span class="smcap">Navarchus</span>.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney exhibited a magnificent specimen of auriferous
quartz, in which the gold was associated with <i>Mispickel</i>, (Arsenical
Pyrites.) The weight of the mass was about five pounds, and the
value of the gold estimated at $1,500. It was obtained from the
celebrated “Fellows Lode,” on the Middle Yuba, in Sierra County.
It is stated, on what is believed to be reliable authority, that from
$200,000 to $250,000 has been taken from an excavation on the
lode only ten feet long and four feet wide, by crushing in hand-mortars.
The occurrence of gold in connection with mispickel, in
the California mines, seems to be rare, at least in the southern
counties. In the specimen presented, the gold formed a coherent,
sponge-like mass, when the mispickel was dissolved.</p>

<p>Baron Richthofen remarked, that gold occurs associated with
mispickel in Silesia.</p>

<p>Mr. R. L. Harris made some remarks on the comparative friction
of car-wheels, on an iron track, when rolling and sliding, as
shown by experiments made on the street-railroad in Washington
street. Here the greatest grade is five hundred and twenty-eight
feet per mile, or one in ten, and it is found that, on a wet day, if
the wheels are stopped by the brakes, they will slide on the track;
while, if the brakes are not put down so hard but that the wheels
can revolve, the car is entirely under control. This is not the
popular opinion, and the authorities generally state, that the sliding
friction is the greatest; but experience shows, that the friction
is really greatest when the sliding and rolling motions are
combined.</p>

<p>Suffrutescent, caudex branching, branches three to four inches in height, somewhat
ascending; rigid, striate, scabrous throughout. Heads solitary and terminal,
homochromous and many-flowered. Leaves alternate, crowded near the
base, oblanceolate, very acute, quite entire, three-nerved; the reticulate veins
and nerves prominent, sub-petiolate (half to one inch in length, by about one-fourth
in breadth); the lowermost leaves more distinctly petiolate, spatulate,
obtuse, or sub-acute; upper cauline leaves few or solitary, lanceolate, very acute
or acuminate, three-nerved.</p>

<p>Involucre campanulate, the greenish somewhat foliaceous scales rigid, many-nerved,
(chiefly three to five) margins scarious, cleft-ciliate, or somewhat fimbriate,
oblanceolate, acute, in three series, often one or two bractoid scales at the
base.</p>

<p>Receptacle flat, alveolate; alveoli toothed, naked. Rays (about eight) orange-yellow,
oblong-oval, two or three-toothed, pistillate, fertile, tube slender, about
as long as the achenia, or one-third to half the length of the ligule.</p>

<p>Disk corolla cylindrical, slightly expanding, five-toothed, erect, glabrous.
The achenia (about twenty, including the ray) angular, oblong, somewhat compressed;
base cuneate, satiny appressed pubescent (with white hairs); pappus
of unequal capillary scabrous bristles, rigid and fragile, or deciduous.</p>

<p>Appendages of the style much longer than the stigmatic portion, lance-subulate,
hispid, much exsert, erect-spreading.</p>

<p>This plant was brought from Nevada Territory by Mr. Herbert C. Dorr.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mirabilis L.</span></h4>

<h5><i>M. Californica</i> Gray, Var. <i>villosa</i> Kellogg.</h5>

<p>Stem about a foot in height, somewhat ascending, flexuous, divaricately
branching, nodose, internodes slightly curved; minutely villous throughout.
Leaves rounded-cordate, obtuse, entire, three to five-nerved; the uppermost
ovate-cordate, petioles short, (one-fourth to one-sixth the length of the lamina).</p>

<p>Flowers pedicellate, in loose terminal dichotomous panicles, with a solitary
flower in the axils; perigonium pink, pedicels recurved in fruit.</p>

<p>This plant, from the interior—Devil’s Gate and Carson River—differs much
from the plate of the coast plant of the Mexican Boundary Report. It is not
at all “glabrous,” nor are the flowers “sub-sessile;” the pairs of leaves are
remote, with a much more open and spreading aspect; the flowers are pentandrous
and deciduous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Harris exhibited a section of a pile, from a wharf at Rincon
Point, which fell a few days since, having been destroyed by the
boring of the <i>Teredo</i>, (properly a <i>Xylotrya</i>.) The material of the
pile is Oregon pine; it had been in the water less than six years,
but is now completely perforated in all directions. The subject of
the best means of protection for piles, against attacks of the <i>Teredo</i>,
was discussed at some length by various members.</p>

<p>Dr. Ayres stated that, as yet, no reliable preventive had been
discovered, except that of sheathing the pile with metal. Several
years ago the same subject came before the Academy, and Drs.
Ayres and Trask were appointed a Committee to investigate the
subject. All external applications which have been proposed fail
in practice, from the wearing away of the surface by the waves,
and they are but little better than the natural bark. It has not
appeared that the saving in time was equal to the expense incurred
by thus protecting the piles. At Boston, where there are two
species destructive of timber, they find no preventive, short of
sheathing the piles with copper.</p>

<p>In the French works on this subject, it has been stated that the
bark affords no protection; but, on the contrary, aids the young
animals in introducing themselves into the wood. This has not been
found to be the case in this bay, where the bark does, on the contrary,
assist in preserving the timber.</p>

<p>The fact was also stated, by one of the members, that the piles
of the wharfs in the southern part of the city suffer much from
attacks of the <i>Teredo</i>; while those of the northern portion are
comparatively exempt. The fact was mentioned, that piles have
been entirely destroyed here in six months from the time they were
placed in the water.</p>

<p>Prof. Brewer made some remarks on the method of calculating
altitudes by observation with a single barometer. He gave an account
of the methods adopted by the Geological Survey for computation,
in cases where there was no station barometer nearer than
the bay, or the valley of the Sacramento.</p>

<p>Dr. Trask mentioned that the weight of the Honcut meteoric
iron presented by him to the Academy, at the meeting of March
17th, 1862, was six ounces, one hundred and twenty-eight grains,
troy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Whitney called attention to the curious errors in a
paper published in Petermann’s Mittheilungen, 1861, page 133,
which purports to be a translation into German of a portion of a
work published by Mr. J. Xantus, describing his journey in Lower
California. He describes a quicksilver mine of great importance
as being worked at Marques; but the description which he gives of
it shows that it is the New Almaden mine which, in reality, he visited,
and which, by some confusion of his notes, he has located in
Lower, instead of Upper California. No mercury mine is worked
on the California peninsula, so far as can be ascertained. It is
evident that Mr. Xantus’s notice of rich gold, lead and copper mines
on the peninsula must be taken with many grains of allowance.</p>

<p>On motion of Dr. Ayres, it was ordered, that twenty-five copies
of the second volume of the Proceedings be placed at the disposal
of the Publishing Committee for distribution to learned societies,
public libraries, and distinguished scientific men in the Atlantic
States.</p>

<h3>Description of two New Species of Bivalve Shells, from the
Tertiaries of Contra Costa County.</h3>

<p class="center">BY AUGUSTE RÉMOND.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cardium</span> Brug.</h4>

<h5><i>C. Gabbii</i> Rémond.</h5>

<p>Shell cordate, ventricose, nearly equilateral; posterior side truncated, direct;
anterior side slightly depressed; height and length nearly equal. Umbones very
prominent; beaks incurved, approximate; lunule well marked, carinated; surface
even, with fine imbricated lines of growth. Hinge (of the left valve) comparatively
narrow; anterior fosset small, shallow, triangular; cartilage pit
large, deep, long; lateral teeth heavy, thick, prominent.</p>

<p>Locality: vicinity of Kirker’s Pass, south of New York (of the Pacific) Plain
from a late tertiary deposit.</p>

<p>The <i>C. Gabbii</i> will easily be distinguished from any other species yet discovered,
from its heavy hinge and enormous lateral teeth. I take great pleasure in
dedicating this beautiful fossil to Mr. W. M. Gabb, to whom I am indebted for
repeated assistance in my palæontological studies.</p>

<p>This species occurs in shelly sands, together with <i>Tapes regularis</i> Gabb and
<i>Murex ponderosus</i> Gabb, two other extinct species. The specimens are in the
collection of Mr. W. M. Gabb and my own.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ostrea L.</span></h4>

<h5><i>O. Bourgeoisii</i> Rémond.</h5>

<p>The description is from two lower valves, from the collections of Mr. l’Abbé
Bourgeois (Pont-Levoy, France) and Mr. Pioche, (San Francisco.)</p>

<p>Shell sub-oval, higher than long, strongly contracted near the cardinal area,
sub-rounded on the ventral margin; inferior valve comparatively thin, convex,
irregular exteriorly, with remote, somewhat rugose, plaits of growth. Ligament
fosset long, profound, minutely wrinkled and finely striated, oblique and
turned downwards; muscular impression very large, oblique, and sub-central,
somewhat prominent.</p>

<p>Locality: vicinity of Kirker’s Pass, from a late tertiary bed.</p>

<p>I dedicate this new species to Mr. Bourgeois, Professor of Natural History
at the School of Pont-Levoy, (Loir-et-Cher, France) who was my first teacher
in geology.</p>

<h3>Description of two Species of Scutella.</h3>

<p class="center">BY AUGUSTE RÉMOND.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Scutella</span> Lam.</h4>

<h5><i>S. Gibbsii</i> Rémond.</h5>

<p>Disk oblong-sub-oval, rounded before and truncated behind, posteriorly convex
above, slightly depressed in front; inferior surface flat, somewhat concave
about the mouth. Apex about midway between the center and posterior margin;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
ambulacral star non-symmetrical; petals unequal, open at their extremities.
Anterior petal straight, longer than the others; the lateral ones nearly
straight, diverging from the apex with an angle of about eighty degrees; posterior
petals very short, sub-oval, having the anterior side most curved. Four
rows of pores in each petal; the inner pores transverse, the outer ones pointed
obliquely inwards. Mouth posteriorly sub-central; anal-aperture small, submarginal.
Ambulacral furrows double, nearly symmetrical, slightly ramified.
Each ambulacral and inter-ambulacral space is occupied by two rows of irregular
plates, either pentagonal or hexagonal. Tubercles numerous, crowded in
the ambulacral furrows, but much worn off in the specimens examined.</p>

<p>Locality: Kern Lake, Buena Vista County.</p>

<p>The specimens described are in the collection of the Academy; they were
found by Dr. Gibbs, to whom the species is dedicated.</p>

<p>Obs.—This species, considered by Mr. Gabb as of probably miocene age, is
closely allied to the <i>S. striatula</i>, which is found living on the Californian coast,
and occurs fossil in the <i>faluns</i> (miocene formation) of Bordeaux, France; but
it differs from it in the outlines and the size of the shell, the former being comparatively
small and longer than broad, while the latter is broader than long.
Besides, the apex of the <i>S. Gibbsii</i> is situated more posteriorly, and the lateral
petals, in the <i>S. striatula</i>, diverge from the apex, with an angle of from one
hundred and ten to one hundred and fifteen degrees; this latter has also its
ambulacral furrows more ramified at their extremities.</p>

<h5><i>S. interlineata</i> W. P. Blake.</h5>

<p>Disk sub-circular, broad, upper surface convex towards the middle, depressed
on the margins, plane beneath; apex central; ambulacral star symmetrical;
petals long, equal, closed at their extremities, nearly reaching from the apex to
the margin of the shell, terminated by five or six irregular hexagonal plates.
The petals are longitudinally divided into four rows, which are connected by
numerous and regular transverse lines of pores. Mouth central; anus submarginal;
ambulacral furrows symmetrical, not much ramified. Inter-ambulacral
areas occupied by two rows of pentagonal plates, convex, of equal length,
increasing in size until they unite with the ambulacral plates; hexagonal from
that point and decreasing towards the margin.</p>

<p>Two sorts of appendages; spinous processes numerous and crowded, above
and beneath. Spines of the superior surface short, striated, pyriform, irregularly
pentagonal or hexagonal; inferior spines slender, comparatively long,
dentaliform, striated longitudinally, tubular and round.</p>

<p>Obs.—Water-worn fragments of this fine fossil occur in abundance on the
beach, between Merced Lake and the Pacific, south of Point Lobos, in San
Francisco County. It was made known to science by Mr. W. P. Blake, Geologist
of the Railroad Survey, who found it in 1853, among the shingles
thrown up by the surf, and first described by Mr. W. Stimpson. At that time
the locality whence the scutellæ were derived had not been discovered, so that
the specimens obtained being imperfect, no complete description could be made;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
this is the reason why I offer a new and complete description of the <i>Scutella
interlineata</i>, from specimens procured <i>in situ</i>. As was suggested by Mr. W. P.
Blake, the rocks bearing these fossils are found a few miles southward, north of
the boundary line between San Mateo and San Francisco Counties, where the
scutellæ stick out from conglomeratic sandstones, which Mr. Gabb considers as
belonging to the <i>pliocene</i> or <i>post-pliocene</i> formation; we find them in a fine state
of preservation, with their spines retained.</p>

<p>The <i>S. interlineata</i> is figured in the Railroad Reports; see vol. V, Geological
Report, plate IV, fig. 30; and for Mr. Blake’s remarks and Mr. Stimpson’s
description, the same Report, chap. XII, p. 153.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. J. Blake made some remarks on specimens, presented by
him, of infusoria, found in the sand-hills, south of Point Lobos, and
which form a kind of concretions, fixing the sand in its place.</p>

<p>Dr. Ayres made the following remarks in relation to the genus
<span class="smcap">Notorhynchus</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This genus was defined by me in 1855 (Proc. Cal. Acad. Nat. Sci., vol. I, p.
72) to include a species occurring in the Bay of San Francisco. In 1858
Girard refers to the species (P. R. R. Rep., vol. X, p. 367) under the generic
name <span class="smcap">Heptanchus</span>, of which he considers <span class="smcap">Notorhynchus</span> a synonym. In 1861,
Mr. Gill refers it to Rafinesque’s genus <span class="smcap">Heptranchias</span>. (Annals of the Lyc.
Nat. Hist., N. Y., vol. VIII, Dec.) In a more recent paper (Proc. Acad. Nat.
Sci., Phil., Oct., 1862) Mr. Gill restores my species to the name under which it
was originally described. He says: “This generic name of <span class="smcap">Notorhynchus</span>
was proposed by Dr. Ayres under a misapprehension.” My “misapprehension”
was that I regarded the species as the type of a new genus; a conclusion
at which Mr. Gill himself has, after several changes, also arrived. He gives as
a synonym of <span class="smcap">Notorhynchus</span> only “<span class="smcap">Heptanchus</span>, Sp. Müller and Henle, Gray,
Girard, Gill,” whereas it is necessary to include also “<span class="smcap">Heptranchias</span>, Gill,” as
above indicated.</p>

<p>I may remark that the description given by Mr. Gill of the teeth of <i>Notorhynchus
maculatus</i>, (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Phil., Oct., 1862, p. 495) will not bear
examination. It represents the individual specimen on which it was founded;
but the species is quite common here, and I find that the number and the forms
of the teeth vary so much, that my original description, which Mr. Gill says is
“equally applicable to any species of the family,” is fully as close as nature will
allow us to draw. I am at a loss to understand how it is possible for him to
refer the jaws of a shark, collected at a point so far removed from us as Nisqually,
to my species, when my description is so extremely indefinite.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Whitney gave an account of an interesting collection
of Japanese minerals and fossils, in the possession of J. H. Van
Reed, Esq., of this city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This collection comprises over one thousand specimens of rocks, ores, fossils,
and miscellaneous objects of natural history. It is supposed that they are chiefly
of Japanese origin; but, as there is among them a fragment of a Dutch tobacco-pipe,
carefully labeled, there may be other objects in the collection from foreign
countries. The articles are all labeled, in the Japanese language: they are
carefully fastened to the cases in which they are arranged, with exquisite Japanese
neatness. The small crystals are inclosed in glass receptacles, having
nearly the form of two large watch-crystals, attached to each other by the edges.</p>

<p>In the general character of the specimens in this collection, a singular resemblance
was noticed to the productions of California, especially in the fossils and
silicified woods, of which latter there are a number of beautiful specimens.
There are several bivalve shells of pliocene or miocene tertiary age, and some
casts of gasteropods, exquisitely formed in chalcedony. A number of sharks’
teeth, of the genus <i>Lamna</i>, were also noticed. Among the fossils is a single
shell of palæozoic age, a <i>Spirifer</i>; it is not impossible, however, that this may
have been carried from China to Japan; at all events, a <i>Spirifer</i> from that
country resembling this, and of Devonian age, has been described in the Proceedings
of the Geological Society of London.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of specimens of copper ore in the collection; they
are all of the common yellow sulphuret, (chalcopyrite) except one or two of
erubescite. This would indicate that the principal ore of this metal in Japan,
as in other countries, is the sulphuret of copper and iron.</p>

<p>Native gold in quartz is also present in the collection; but no ores of silver
were noticed, except one specimen of steel-grained galena, which is probably
argentiferous. There are several specimens of realgar. Among the other minerals
noticed were: calcite, adularia, chalybite, in the form of <i>flos ferri</i>, garnets,
small crystals of pyroxene, crystals of mica, pectolite, and another zeolitic mineral
resembling Thomsonite, as also native sulphur, obsidian, and a variety of
volcanic rocks and lavas.</p>

<p>The collection is quite interesting, and would be more so if the labels could
be read. The principal inference to be drawn from it, is the predominance of
volcanic formations, and of the later tertiary strata, in the region in which this
collection was made.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Ayres called attention to a remarkable turtle, in the possession
of Mr. Van Reed, known as the “Sacred Turtle” of the Japanese.
It is a species of Emys, closely allied to <i>E. terrapin</i>. Its marked
peculiarity is, that its back is covered by a growth of <i>conferva</i>,
which is often several inches long, and which gives the animal its
sacred character among the Japanese, who believe this growth to
be <i>hair</i>. The species is allied to <i>C. rivularis</i>; but the cells are
more elongated. Dr. Ayres stated that he had observed a growth
of <i>conferva</i> on various aquatic and amphibious animals in New
England, and that, in these, it was always attended by disease, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
more or less ulcerated at the roots. He was satisfied that this was
always the case with fishes exhibiting this growth. The turtle in
question, however, does not show any evidence of disease.</p>

<p>Dr. Ayres made some further remarks on the similarity of the
fishes of Mr. Van Reed’s collection to species found in California.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabb noticed a resemblance in the fossils to those of this
State.</p>

<p>Dr. Trask stated, that the tree cotton presented by him was said
to be the produce of a shrub from four to fifteen feet high. It is
described as growing in a pod like a banana, the shrub forming a
high chaparral. The staple is long and fine; but nothing is known
of its commercial value.</p>

<p>Dr. Behr remarked that it closely resembled species of <span class="smcap">Bombax</span>
and <span class="smcap">Eriodendron</span>, abundant in South America and the East
Indies, but not there considered as of value as a substitute for
cotton.</p>

<p>Dr. Trask made some remarks in regard to certain species of
<span class="smcap">Conferva</span>, which appear to be sensitive, like the species of
<span class="smcap">Schrankia</span>.</p>

<p>Prof. Brewer stated that he had recently received a communication
from Professor Planchon, of South France, in regard to suitable
forage plants for dry regions. In that country the <i>Medicago
sativa</i>, or Lucerne, was considered the most valuable, and next to
it the Sainfoin.</p>

<p>Shell with the aperture sub-oval, obliquely expanded towards the
left, posteriorly ronaded, and wider anteriorly. Internal shelf reaching
forward about one-fifth the length of the shell, its margin slightly
concave and oblique.</p>

<p>Dorsal surface convex, becoming somewhat keel-shaped towards
the apex, which is strongly and obliquely deflected so as to make the
right border nearly a straight line, while the expansion on the left
projects nearly as far back as the apex, at an obtuse angle. Structure
corneous, with strong concentric lines of growth, and faint radiating
striæ. Color dark brown, opaque; inner surface shining and
purplish, the plate white towards the edge, and in some specimens
showing a thickened, white semicircle continuous with its margin
across the arch of the shell.</p>

<p>Length about sixteen one-hundredths, breadth eight one-hundredths,
and height six one-hundredths of an English inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>More than fifty specimens were found on water plants in clear stagnant ponds,
two or more often sticking on the back of a larger one.</p>

<p>The discovery of this little shell in California is of great interest, the only
species hitherto known being found in Cuba. The generic characters of this
shell are strictly parallel with that species, while those mentioned as specific
easily distinguish it. The Cuban shell is more elongated, regularly oval, the
apex projecting considerably beyond the margin of the aperture, which is not
obliquely expanded posteriorly. Its size is about one-fifth larger than that of
ours. According to Bourguignat, the young shell is a simple obtuse cone, with
a semicircular aperture formed by the edge of the shelf, and the thickened
dorsal margin; but as it grows, the animal changes the form of the aperture
until the opening beneath the shelf becomes like the small end of a broad funnel,
which in some of our specimens is still shown by the white semicircular
ring.</p>

<p>The shell much resembles that of the marine <i>Crypta</i> (<i>Crepidula</i>), and also
<i>Navicella</i> of tropical estuaries; but the animal is quite different in the Cuban
species, and will undoubtedly prove so in the Californian.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney read the following communication in regard
to the progress of the State Geological Survey of California.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Act of the Legislature authorizing a geological survey of this State
was approved April 21st, 1860; but operations were not commenced until
about the first of December of that year, consequently the work has been in
progress for a little more than two years.</p>

<p>The plan of the survey, according to the requirements of the act by which it
was organized, demands “an accurate and complete geological survey of the
State,” and a report containing “a full and scientific description of its rocks,
fossils, soils, and minerals, and of its botanical and zoological productions.”
Provision is also made for the collection of specimens in all departments of
geology and natural history, which specimens are to be deposited “in such place
as shall be hereafter provided for that purpose by the Legislature.”</p>

<p>The following persons have been employed on the survey since it was commenced:
Professor W. H. Brewer, as Principal Assistant, and specially in
charge of the department of Botany and Agricultural Geology. Professor
Brewer, however, up to the present time, has been chiefly engaged in the geological
field work of the Survey. Mr. William Ashburner was employed from
the commencement of the work, up to the spring of 1862, in the field; and, for
a considerable portion of the time, in examining the gold-quartz mines and
machinery in the principal mining counties of the Sierra Nevada. Mr. A.
Rémond served as volunteer, in the field work, during the season of 1862. Mr.
W. M. Gabb took the place of Palæontologist to the Survey at the beginning
of the year 1862, which position he still continues to hold. Mr. C. Averill was
connected with the Survey from its commencement up to the month of February
last, as Clerk, Commissary, and Barometrical Observer. Dr. J. G.
Cooper has been in charge of the department of Zoology, and has been employed,
at intervals, as the financial condition of the Survey permitted, since
July 1st, 1861. In the topographical department, Mr. C. F. Hoffmann has
been employed constantly since March, 1861; and Mr. V. Wackenreuder, at
intervals, during the past year.</p>

<p>The uncertainty peculiar to all undertakings of this kind in the United
States, arising from the necessity of appealing to each successive Legislature
for the means of carrying on the work, and the disturbed state of the country
during the whole time since we commenced operations, as also the unfortunate
condition of the finances of the State, which has kept the treasury from one to
two years behind in the payment of the legislative appropriations, have combined
to render it difficult to arrange and carry out as systematic a plan for the
conduct of the work as would, under more favorable circumstances, have been
practicable.</p>

<p>Two ideas have, however, as far as possible, governed the survey in its operations:
the first was, to make, as rapidly as could be done, a reconnoissance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the State, with the view of acquiring a knowledge of its general geological
structure, the age of the various formations which occur in it, and as complete
a general idea as possible of their range and extent, so that a foundation
might be laid for the detailed work which would follow the preliminary examination;
the second idea was, at the same time that the general examination
was going on, to work up in detail certain more important districts, so that the
public might have light on questions of economical interest, and at the same
time be able to form an idea of what the work might be if ever carried to completion.
Besides this, the natural history part of the survey was to be carried
on, in connection with the geological work, as rapidly as possible, progress in all
departments being necessarily proportioned to the varying amounts of the annual
appropriations.</p>

<p>California is covered by a vast net-work of mountain ranges, separated by
comparatively narrow valleys, with the exception of those of the Sacramento
and San Joaquin, which do not, together, cover more than one-fifteenth of the
area of the State. The remaining fourteen-fifteenths may be called mountainous,
as the valleys include but a small portion of its surface. Into this mountainous
region no accurate surveys have ever been carried; even the General
Land Office work stops at the base of the mountains. A few ranch lines have
been run among the moderately elevated portions of the Coast Ranges; but, as
a general thing, the genuine Mexican grants were limited to the plains.</p>

<p>Without considerable topographical work in connection with the geological
survey we should, then, be entirely unable to carry on our geological work with
any pretense to accuracy, as we could neither locate our observations nor make
our descriptions of the country intelligible. The authority for doing something
for the increase of the geographical knowledge of the State is found in the clause
of the act authorizing the survey, which requires “proper maps” to accompany
the reports.</p>

<p>What has been done, up to the present time, in this department may be
briefly recapitulated as follows:</p>

<p>A series of maps, forty-nine in number, has been compiled by Mr. Hoffmann
from the original documents at the United States Surveyor-General’s Office;
the scale of these is half an inch to the mile. They contain a compilation of
nearly all that is known at that office in regard to the geography of the State.
The maps, as thus blocked out, have been used by us in the field, by filling in
the topography wherever our route has laid.</p>

<p>The maps which have been or are now being prepared for publication are:</p>

<p>1st. A map of the vicinity of the Bay of San Francisco, on a scale of half
an inch to the mile, four feet by three; it extends from near Santa Cruz on the
south to Napa on the north, and from the Pacific to Corral Hollow, east and
west. The area of land which it covers is 4,248 square miles, which is just
twice that of the State of Delaware, and only lacks two hundred square miles
of equaling that of Connecticut. As near as can be ascertained, it contains
one-third of the population of the State, and has about thirty inhabitants to
the square mile—the average density of the population of California being
but little over two to the square mile. This map, on which all the details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the topography are given, as minutely as the scale allows, is nearly completed,
and will be soon ready for the engraver.</p>

<p>2d. A detailed map, on a scale of two inches to the mile, of the vicinity of
Mount Diablo; this is about two and one-half by three feet in dimensions, and
includes the most important coal mining district yet known to exist in the State.
The map can be made ready for the engraver in a few days.</p>

<p>3d. A map of the Coast Ranges, from the Bay of Monterey south to Santa
Barbara. It is about three feet by two and one-half in dimensions, is on a scale
of six miles to the inch, and embraces about 16,000 square miles of territory.
To complete it will require about another year’s work in the field with two sub-parties.</p>

<p>4th. Map of the Washoe silver-mining region—three and one-half by two and
one-half feet in dimensions, on a scale of two inches to the mile—and extending
over all the important mining ground of the district. This map is from an
accurate trigonometrical survey by V. Wackenreuder; it is nearly completed.</p>

<p>5th. Map of the Comstock Lode, on a scale of four hundred feet to the inch,
completed.</p>

<p>6th. Map of the central portion of the Sierra Nevada; scale not yet determined
on. Extensive surveys have been made by Mr. Wackenreuder for this part
of the work, and these will be continued during the present season.</p>

<p>Of the above mentioned maps, Nos. 1 and 2 will accompany the first volume
of the Report. Nos. 4, 5, and probably 6, the second volume.</p>

<p>It is intended, if the survey is carried to completion, to construct a final map
of the State on a scale of six miles to the inch, in nine sheets, each about three
feet square.</p>

<p>In addition to the regular topographical work, an extensive series of barometrical
observation has been made, for the determination of altitudes, some two
hundred and fifty important points having been ascended and measured. The
most interesting operation in this department was the determination of the
height of Mount Shasta, which, by an elaborate series of observations, we found
to be 14,440 feet above the sea level. This is the first of the lofty volcanic
peaks of the Sierra Nevada which has been accurately measured.</p>

<p>In the department of geology proper, our explorations have extended over
portions of forty of the forty-six counties into which the State is divided; and
when it is remembered that the average size of a county is equal to half that of
the State of Massachusetts, (California having just twenty-four times the area
of that State,) some idea of the magnitude of our work may be obtained. The
chain of the Sierra Nevada may be parallelized with that of the Alps for extent
and average elevation; while the Coast Ranges are nearly as extensive as the
Appalachian chain of mountains.</p>

<p>We have obtained a pretty clear idea of the general structure of the Coast
Ranges from Los Angeles to Clear Lake; the vicinity of the Bay of San
Francisco has been worked out in considerable detail, including all of San
Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and Marin Counties,
with portions of Santa Cruz, Solano, Napa, and Sonoma. Considerable
field-work has been done in the Sierra Nevada, chiefly in the lower portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the range between Mariposa and Shasta Counties. Our observations have also
been extended to the Washoe Region, and we have received considerable collections
of fossils from the Humboldt Mining District, (known by this name on
the Pacific Coast, but designated on Warren’s Map as the “West Humboldt
River Range,” and in longitude 180°) by which we have been able to fix the
age of the formations in that region.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabb has been chiefly occupied, the past year, in figuring and describing
the cretaceous fossils of the Coast Ranges and the foot-hills of the Sierra, of
which he has nearly two hundred new species ready for publication. He has
also described the triassic fossils, collected by the Survey at Washoe, and by
Gorham Blake, Esq., in the Humboldt Range. The fossils older than the
Trias have been referred to Mr. Meek for investigation. A portion of the fossil
plants have been placed in the hands of Dr. J. S. Newberry for description.</p>

<p>It is to the department of General Geology that, up to the present time, by
far the greater portion of our attention has been given, since the first thing
required in a geological survey is a knowledge of the general geological structure
of the State, the age of the various formations which occur in it, and their
range and extent, or the position which they occupy on the surface, and their
relations to each other. Each group of strata, thus determined by its lithological
peculiarities, and by the fossils which it contains, is then to be laid down
upon the map, in the position in which its outcrop occupies on the surface.
The general character of the minerals and ores which occur in each formation
or group of strata having been thus determined, the details of their mode of
occurrence, their relative abundance, and the facilities which may exist in each
separate district for making them economically available must, after the preliminary
general work has been done, be the object of more special and detailed
examinations. It is not, however, the business of a geological surveying corps
to act, to any considerable extent, as a prospecting party; to do this, would
require that we should confine our operations to a very limited area; the labors
of the whole corps for an entire season would not suffice to thoroughly prospect
more than a few hundred square miles in a very rich mineral region, and we
should have often to engage in expensive mining operations to decide what was
really of permanent value. It is our task, rather, to limit the field of research,
and to show to others where their labors will be best bestowed, preventing foolish
expenditures of time and money in searching for what our general geological
investigations have determined not to exist in sufficient quantity, in certain
formations, to be worth working. Especially in the first years of our work, in
a State of such an immense area as California, our labors have more the character
of a geological reconnoissance than of a detailed survey.</p>

<p>Already, however, during the progress of our work, a large amount of information
has been collected in regard to the mode of occurrence and abundance of
the useful ores and minerals of this State and the adjoining Territories. The
principal deposits of coal have been carefully examined, and their geological
position ascertained. Most of the important quartz mines of the State have
been visited by Mr. Ashburner, and a large amount of information has been
collected by him, preparatory to an elaborate investigation and report on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
important branch of the industry of the Pacific Coast. Considerable work has
been done, preliminary to a full report on the geology, mineralogy, and metallurgy
of the Washoe region.</p>

<p>In the department of botany and agricultural geology, the work has thus far
been chiefly confined to collecting the plants of the State.</p>

<p>Extensive duplicate suites have been preserved both for study and exchange,
the specimens now collected amounting to not less than twelve thousand or fifteen
thousand in number, and embracing probably half of all the species described
from the State, besides many new and undescribed ones. The collections
have been made by Professor Brewer while engaged in geological explorations,
at a very trifling expenditure of time and money.</p>

<p>In the department of Agriculture proper, less has been done, owing to limited
means. Partial preparation was made for investigating the subject of grape
culture, and the production of wines; but discontinued from the same cause.
Especial attention has been paid to our native forage plants, to aid in devising
some means of arresting the rapid decrease of forage in this State, and correspondence
entered into to obtain all possible information on this subject from
other regions whose climates are similar to our own.</p>

<p>In the zoölogical department—in charge of Dr. J. G. Cooper, who has been
employed about half the time since the Survey was commenced—the annexed
table gives a succinct idea of what had been accomplished, up to the close of
the year 1862, in the way of collecting.</p>

<p>Of Articulata and Radiata no statistics can be given for want of works
especially devoted to the California species.</p>

<p>From this it appears that, notwithstanding the large collections made by
Government expeditions and by individuals, during the last ten years, which
have been elaborately described in the Pacific Railroad and Mexican Boundary
Reports, the Smithsonian publications, and various other works, we have been
able to add materially to the known Fauna of California, and of the country
at large, even among the highest and best known classes.</p>

<p>Arrangements have been made for having the collections in natural history
referred to the highest authorities in each branch, and portions of our materials
have already been placed at the disposition of eminent men in Europe and the
United States for examination and description.</p>

<p>Deferring the fitting up of a laboratory, and the engaging of a special assistant
in the chemical department, until a suitable permanent place could be provided
in the State Museum building, Mr. Ashburner went East in the spring of
1862 and commenced the examination of some of the ores and minerals of the
State in the laboratory of the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale College, under
the direction of Professor Brush, who has charge of the metallurgical department
of that institution. The reduction of the appropriation to fifteen thousand
(15,000) dollars for the year, made it necessary to suspend this work soon
after it was commenced, in order that the whole force of the Survey might be
concentrated on the field operations.</p>

<p>A small sum has been allowed to Mr. F. H. Storer, of Boston, for a chemical
investigation of the bituminous substances found in different parts of the
State. His researches will probably be embodied in the first or second volume
of the annual reports. Qualitative examinations, as well as a few quantitative
ones, have been made at the office of the Survey, of specimens which have been
collected. A considerable number of coals have been analyzed. Information
in regard to ores and minerals has been given to a large number of persons who
have applied for the same by letter or otherwise, as will always be done when
practicable.</p>

<p>If the survey is continued, it will be necessary to fit up a complete laboratory,
in which the important questions constantly arising, both in regard to the composition
and metallurgic treatment of our ores, may be carefully and systematically
investigated.</p>

<p>No provision has yet been made by the Legislature for the arrangement and
exhibition of the collections made by the Survey. These are already quite extensive,
embracing many thousand specimens of rocks, fossils, minerals, ores, all
of which are of importance in illustrating the Natural History, the geological
structure and the mineral resources of the State. Such as have not been required
for study remain packed in boxes, and are stored at the office of the
Survey in Montgomery Block, San Francisco.</p>

<p>Of course it is highly desirable that a permanent, fire-proof building should
be provided for the State collections, the proper disposition of which is a subject
of great interest, not only as connected with the welfare and progress of
the survey, but as influencing the educational and material progress of the State.</p>

<p>The only official step thus far taken in this matter is the appointment, by the
last Legislature, of the State Geologist, the State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, and the State Surveyor-General as a Board of Commissioners “to
report to the Legislature, on or before the second Monday of December, 1863,
upon the feasibility of establishing a State University, embracing an Agricultural
College, a School of Mines, and a Museum, <i>including the geological collections
of the State</i>.”</p>

<p>A considerable number of specimens, some of them of value, have been
already given to the State by individuals; and there can be no doubt that many
interesting and valuable articles would be contributed, provided it were demonstrated
that they would be properly exhibited, and well taken care of. It is
believed, that when the State Museum is once established, and a suitable building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
provided, the value and importance of it to the people will soon be made so
clear, that it will be sustained and fostered by the Legislature.</p>

<p>By the terms of the Act of the Legislature authorizing a Geological Survey
of the State of California, it was made the duty of the State Geologist to present
to the Governor, to be laid before the Legislature, as near as may be to
the beginning of each session, a “Report of Progress,” in which the operations
of the Survey during the preceding year should be set forth, and its more important
practical results made public. He is also required to communicate an
account of the expenditures, and to furnish estimates for the continuance of the
Survey.</p>

<p>By an Act of the Legislature of 1862, however, the State Geologist was
authorized to combine his first and second annual reports into one volume, to be
printed during the winter of 1862 and 1863, and an appropriation of $3,000
was made to pay the expenses of printing, engraving, etc., while the size, form,
and style of the report, and the place of printing, were left to the discretion of
the State Geologist, under the advice and with the approval of the Governor.</p>

<p>According to this, there is a report now due the State; but, as no part of
the appropriation of last year for the continuance of the Survey has been yet
received, or is likely to be, for months to come, and as the appropriation for
printing is in the same condition, the work has been necessarily delayed. As it
is presumed that the amount due the Survey from last year will be available
some time next winter, it is not anticipated that there will be any difficulty in
issuing the first volume; and, if the Legislature takes the necessary steps early
in the session, two, or perhaps three, volumes can be published in 1864. It is
intended that they shall be of royal octavo size, in the best style of typography,
and illustrated with maps, sections, plates of fossils, etc. The maps will be engraved
on copper and printed from transfers, in order the original plates may be
preserved, to be used, after necessary corrections and revisions, in the final report,
or otherwise, as may be found desirable. The maps will be sold separately, with
or without the geological coloring, as desired. The first volume will be
chiefly devoted to the geology of the Coast Ranges; the second to that of the
Sierra Nevada and the mining districts of the eastern slope. If my plans are
not thwarted by the Legislature, both these volumes will be issued together
next year, and will form a “Report of a Geological Reconnoissance of the State
of California.” By the law, as it now stands, the publications of the Survey
are required to be copy-righted, and sold for the benefit of the Common School
Fund; hence, it has been impossible to communicate to the public, from time
to time, through the medium of the Academy’s publications, the results which
have been obtained. It is proper to say, in this connection, that the extent of
territory to be examined, the complexity of the phenomena, and the bearing
which our investigations will have on important questions of economical interest,
make it eminently proper that there should not be an undue haste exhibited, on
the part of the Survey, to place its results before the world. We can only hope
to influence the mining public, in this State, by degrees; and it is necessary,
first of all, that it should be made clearly to appear, with the lapse of time, that
our statements are to be relied on as closely approximating to the truth.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney communicated the following letter from Professor
Brush, giving the results of a chemical investigation of the
meteoric iron presented to the city of San Francisco, by General
Carleton:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Sheffield Laboratory of Yale College,<br />
New Haven</span>, March 30th, 1863.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Professor J. D. Whitney, State Geologist, San Francisco, Cal.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—I have examined the specimen of meteoric iron from Tucson,
which you sent me for analysis, and herewith communicate to you my results.</p>

<p>The density of the mass is 7.29. When a fragment of it is placed in a solution
of neutral sulphate of copper, it quickly becomes coated with metallic copper,
proving the iron to be “active.” An inspection of the specimen with a
lens showed it to be dotted with little cavities, which on the fresh fracture were
lined with a white silicious mineral, giving the surface a porphyritic, or pseudo-porphyritic,
appearance.</p>

<p>When a fragment was attacked with an acid, a portion of the iron was dissolved,
leaving the silicious mineral projecting from the surface of the specimen;
and with a magnifier, black particles of Schreibersite could be seen. After complete
solution of the iron, a careful microscopic examination was made of the
insoluble residue. With a magnifying power of 25 diameters, it appeared to
consist chiefly of two substances: one a milk-white to transparent mineral, having
a fused, rounded surface, occurring in little globules, or elongated, rounded
particles; while the other constituent was black and angular, and attractable
by the magnet. The first named substance, when observed with a magnifying
power of 100 diameters, proved to contain minute specks of the black mineral
disseminated through it; some of the silicious fragments were translucent and
of a milk-white color, and others colorless and transparent; a large number,
however, were transparent at one end, shading into milk-white at the other, thus
seeming to indicate that the transparent and translucent portions were not two
distinct minerals. A blowpipe examination of the silicious mineral showed it
to have characters very much resembling <i>olivine</i>. The black mineral proved to
be <i>Schreibersite</i>. A minute trace of chromium was also observed in the insoluble
residue.</p>

<p>The qualitative analysis of the portion soluble in nitric acid indicated the
presence of iron, nickel, cobalt, copper, phosphorus, lime, and magnesia with
unweighable traces of chlorine, sulphur, and alumina. For the quantitative
examination of the meteorite a fragment weighing 4.3767 grammes was treated
with nitro-chlorohydric acid (aqua regia), and after solution of the iron the
whole was evaporated; on approaching dryness, gelatinous silica separated,
showing that the silicate had been partially, at least, decomposed by the acid.
After heating until the silica was rendered insoluble, it was repeatedly treated
with acid and evaporated, so as to insure the oxydation of all the Schreibersite,
and finally the soluble part was taken up with chlorohydric acid, and on dilution
separated by filtration from the silica and insoluble residue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The filtrate, or <i>soluble</i> part, was accurately measured and divided into four
portions for analysis—two portions were used for the determination of the iron,
nickel, cobalt, phosphorus, and alkaline earths; a third portion was employed
to estimate the copper, and the fourth portion was reserved to answer in case
of accident.</p>

<p>Two methods were used for the separation of the iron from the nickel and
cobalt—one by precipitation of the iron as basic acetate, and the other by precipitation
with carbonate of baryta in the presence of an excess of chloride of
ammonium; but in neither case was the separation perfected on the first precipitation,
and traces of nickel remained with the iron even after the second
precipitation. The nickel and cobalt were separated by means of nitrite of potash,
and the cobalt was subsequently converted into sulphate and as such
weighed. The lime and magnesia were separated by oxalate of ammonia, care
being taken to redissolve and reprecipitate the lime to insure its being free from
traces of magnesia. On spectroscopic examination of the precipitate, it proved
to be lime, free from other alkaline earths.</p>

<p>The precipitate of iron, after being weighed, was fused with carbonate of
soda; the product of the fusion was dissolved in chlorohydric acid, and the
phosphoric acid precipitated with molybdate of ammonia. This phospho-molybdic
precipitate was dissolved in ammonia to free it from possible traces of silica
and other impurities, and the phosphoric acid precipitated from this solution by
an ammoniacal mixture of sulphate of magnesia and chloride of ammonium.</p>

<p>The copper was precipitated as sulphide by sulphuretted hydrogen gas, redissolved
in nitric acid, and determined as oxyd.</p>

<p>The <i>insoluble residue</i>, containing free silica and undecomposed silicate, was
perfectly white, and free from all traces of Schreibersite. It weighed 0.1855
grm. equal to 4.24 per cent. of the specimen analyzed. It was fused with carbonate
of soda, and the silica and bases determined in the usual manner. It
contained 0.159 grm. silica; 0.0054 protoxyd of iron, with a minute trace of
alumina; 0.0028 lime, and 0.0168 magnesia.</p>

<p>The soluble and insoluble portions gave in the analysis the following per centage

<p>If the silica found in this analysis be considered to exist in combination
with lime, magnesia, and iron, in the proportions to form olivine, it will be necessary
to deduct 2.12 per cent. from the amount of metallic iron (equal to 2.73
per cent. of protoxyd of iron), in order to give the silicate the olivine formula,
(3 R O, Si O₃). Admitting this to be the correct view, the mass analyzed contains
10.07 per cent. of olivine, and by the addition of the oxygen of the protoxyd
of iron the analysis adds up 99.69 instead of 99.08.</p>

<p>The variable composition of Schreibersite in different specimens of meteoric
iron, and the peculiar character of the insoluble residue of this meteorite, together
with the small amount of material in my possession, rendered it impracticable
to determine the exact amount of this substance contained in the specimen.</p>

<p>The composition of this meteorite corresponds very closely with another
meteoric-iron from Tucson, discovered by Mr. Bartlett, and described by Prof.
J. Lawrence Smith, in the <i>American Journal of Science</i>, vol. XIX, page 161.
Dr. Smith’s analysis gives Iron 85.54, Nickel 8.55, Cobalt 0.61, Copper 0.03,
Phosphorus 0.12, Chromic-oxyd 0.21, Magnesia 2.04, Silica 3.02, Alumina,
trace = 100.18. He considers it to correspond to Nickeliferous Iron 93.81,
Chrome Iron 0.41, Schreibersite 0.84, Olivine 5.06 = 100.18. By an evident
inadvertence Dr. Smith adds the magnesia and silica together, and gives the
sum as olivine; these substances are obviously not in the proportions to form
the silicate 3 R O, Si O₃, and if we consider the silicate to be olivine, we must
reckon the excess of silica as combined with protoxyd of iron. To do this, we
must deduct 2.78 from the amount of metallic iron (equal to 2.58 protoxyd of
iron), necessary to be combined with the silica and magnesia to give the olivine
formula. The amount of olivine contained in the Bartlett meteoric-iron will
then be 8.64 per cent. Thus the two masses of iron will be seen to agree very
nearly in composition, the only trifling difference being, that Dr. Smith has
determined quantitatively the small amount of chromium contained in the Bartlett
meteorite, while I have found a little lime and traces of sulphur and chlorine
in the specimen you sent to me. The specific gravity I have stated to be
7.39; this was taken on about 12.5 grammes of the iron, and probably is somewhat
higher than the portion which I analyzed, as the two surfaces of the larger
mass had been rubbed down, and as thus a considerable portion of the exposed
silicate would be mechanically removed, it would make the density correspondingly
higher.</p>

<p>I regret that I had not more of this interesting meteorite at my command, in
order to have determined more definitely and satisfactorily the character of the
insoluble residue. I shall be glad to make a further investigation of this point
if you will supply me with more material.</p>

<p class="center">Very respectfully yours,</p>

<p class="right">GEO. J. BRUSH.</p>

<p>After reading the above letter, Professor Whitney added some
remarks on the form and locality of the meteoric iron analyzed by
Professor Brush, stating the circumstances under which it came in
possession of the city of San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>On the twenty-fourth of November, 1862, the Board of Supervisors
of this city received, through Mayor Teschemacher, a letter
from General George Wright, commanding the Department of the
Pacific, stating that he had received a mass of meteoric iron from
General Carleton, commanding the “Column from California,” and
which mass he, in accordance with General Carleton’s request,
placed at the disposal of the city authorities.</p>

<p>General Carleton’s letter is here appended:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Head Quarters Column from California</span>,<br />
Tucson, Arizona, June 30th, 1862.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i><span class="smcap">To General George Wright</span>, U. S. Army,
Commander Dep. of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>:—Soon after my arrival at this place I sent by a train to
Fort Yuma, to be shipped to your address at San Francisco, a very large and
beautiful <span class="smcap">Aerolite</span>, which I found here and which I had heard and read of for
many years. In <i>Bartlett’s Explorations</i>, vol. 2, page 297, it is described as follows:
“In the afternoon,” July 18th, 1853, “I called to take leave of General
Blanco, and at the same time examine a remarkable <i>meteorite</i>, which is used for
an anvil in a blacksmith’s shop. This mass resembles native iron, and weighs
about six hundred pounds. Its greatest length is five feet. Its exterior is
quite smooth, while the lower part which projects from the larger leg is very
jagged and rough. It was found about twenty miles distant on the road
towards Tubac and about eight miles from the road.”</p>

<p>I desire that you present this aerolite to the City of San Francisco, to be
placed upon the <span class="smcap">Plaza</span>, there to remain for the inspection of the people and for
examination by the youth of the city forever. It will be a durable memento of
the march of the <i>Column from California</i>.</p>

<p class="center">I am, General, sincerely and respectfully,</p>

<p class="center">Your friend and servant,</p>

<p class="right">JAMES H. CARLETON,<br />
<i>Brigadier General U. S. A.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Soon after this mass of meteoric iron came into the possession of
the city, I obtained permission from the Board of Supervisors to
have sawn from it a small piece for analysis and for distribution to
a few of the principal public institutions in this country and Europe
having collections of aerolites; this has been done, and also a fine
photograph of it taken by Mr. C. E. Watkins, of which copies will
be forwarded, with the specimens of the mass itself, as convenient
opportunity offers.</p>

<p>The piece intended for analytical examination was sent to Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Brush of Yale College, and a letter has just been received
from him giving the results, which will be found in the preceding
pages, and which may appropriately be followed by a few remarks
on the size and general appearance of the mass, with such other
facts in regard to it as may be of general interest.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The weight of the mass of which the analysis is given above was six hundred
and thirty-two pounds, when it arrived in this city, and about two pounds have
been since cut from it.</p>

<p>Its shape is irregular, but in general it is that of a flattened elongated
slab, having a length of four feet one inch and an average breadth of about
eighteen inches; its thickness is irregular, varying from two to five inches. It
has evidently been long used as an anvil, having been partly buried in the
ground in an upright position, having a flat face of about four inches square on
the top, with two holes drilled in the projecting edge for adding to the convenience
of its use as a blacksmith’s anvil.</p>

<p>The mass is now placed in the Mayor’s office, it having been deemed inadvisable
to expose it on the Plaza, as desired by the donor, on account of its liability
to rust in the damp atmosphere of San Francisco, and the difficulty of
securing it from injury by careless or mischievous handling.</p>

<p>Professor Brush remarks that “the composition of this meteorite corresponds
very closely with that of <i>another</i> meteoric iron from Tucson” discovered by
Mr. Bartlett and analyzed by Professor J. Lawrence Smith. A comparison of
the analyses of Professors Brush and Smith and a reference to Mr. Bartlett’s
work seem to render it highly probable, to say the least, that the two analyses
were of pieces cut from the same mass.</p>

<p>In this connection I will add to General Carleton’s quotation from Mr. Bartlett’s
book a few lines which complete what is said in regard to the meteorites
seen by him at Tucson. Mr. Bartlett adds, after stating that the mass was
found about twenty miles distant towards Tubac and about eight miles from the
road, “where we were told are many larger masses. The annexed drawing
gives the appearance of this singular mass. There is another large mass within
the garrison grounds, of which I did not take a sketch. With much labor
Dr. Webb broke off a fragment of this meteorite, for the purpose of analysis.”</p>

<p>The wood cut which Mr. Bartlett gives of the meteoric iron, which he notices
as having been used as an anvil, shows at once, as does also the description, that,
contrary to General Carleton’s idea, this mass and the one which is now in San
Francisco, are not the same. The mass figured by Mr. Bartlett is of a very
peculiar shape, well adapting it to use as a common blacksmith’s anvil, as it
has a broad, flat top, and is supported by two legs.</p>

<p>In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to suppose that
the mass forwarded by General Carleton is the one spoken of by Mr. Bartlett
as “another larger mass,” and of which no drawing was made; while, on the
other hand, a piece was taken for analysis. This piece is almost certainly the
one analyzed by Dr. Smith, and hence the close agreement in the two analyses—this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
chemist, however, not having apparently made so complete a separation of
the nickel as Prof. Brush has done. Still it is possible, of course, that different
portions of the mass may differ slightly in composition.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Infusoria from the Moving Sands in the Neighborhood of
San Francisco.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.</p>

<p>The infusoria to which I would call the attention of the Society, were collected
from the sands in the neighborhood of Point Lobos. These sands form
a moving surface, which in dry weather is drifted by the prevailing winds from
the shore of the ocean landwards, and are entirely devoid of any signs of vegetation
for some distance from the shore. On walking over these sands when a
strong north-west wind was blowing, a wind that does not bring up any fresh
sand from the ocean beach at that part of the sand field, I noticed a number of
small sized bodies projecting above the surface of the sand as it was being
carried onwards by the wind. A closer examination showed that these bodies
were formed of particles of sand, agglutinated together by some substance which
rendered them almost black, and where dried possessing considerable tenacity.
Some of these bodies projected as much as an inch and a half above the surface
of the sand, with which however they all remained connected, forming generally
small ridges. On examining a portion of this agglutinated sand under the
microscope, the water with which I had moistened it was found to be full of
infusoria, which commenced moving about as soon as the sand was moistened,
although it had been quite dry for some days before being examined. These
infusoria probably belong to the genus Monas, but they are so extremely minute
that it was impossible to resolve them; they were, in fact, the smallest living
infusoria I had ever examined. With a quarter-inch object glass of Powell and
Lelands, they appeared as small globular moving bodies, although occasionally a
movement would present one of them with apparently a narrow edge. Nothing
much more definite could be made out with the microscope of my friend, Dr.
Trask, when using an eighth object glass of Smith and Beck, as they could not
be resolved into any form sufficiently definite to classify them. They appeared
mostly as globular bodies moving about slowly, and presenting sometimes a
longer axis, one end being larger than the other, and offering the appearance as
if there was a semi-transparent mass attached to the larger end. The size was
estimated at from a fifteenth to the twenty-thousandth of an inch. After a
careful examination I was unable to detect any vegetable or organic nucleus
which might have served as a nidus for these masses of infusoria. They would
seem to become developed in the pure sand, or at least in the sand as it was
blown up from the beach, after the salt had been washed out of it by the rain.
[I would remark that it had been raining some days before I collected them.]
Subsequent researches have shown that these infusoria are very generally
diffused through the sands that form our drifting sand-hills around the city; and
on examining some sand taken at a depth of fourteen feet from the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
where the hills were being cut through, I found it full of well developed infusoria
on placing it under the microscope a few minutes after it had been collected, so
that there can be no doubt but that these infusoria were present in the sand at
the time it was collected, where they had probably been in a torpid state for
ages. It is possible that they might have been carried there by the infiltrating
water during the rains; but I am inclined to think that they had been torpid
there, as the circumstances in which they were placed were not favorable for
propagation except by fission, a process that cannot be carried on indefinitely,
even in these lower organisms. In fact, these infusoria, taken from the deep
sands, copulated most extensively the moment they were placed in water. I am
not aware that analogous observations have been made as to the office of these
lower infusoria in fixing the moving sands, and thus initiating that series of
changes by which they eventually become clothed with verdure; the first germs
of organic life being generally supposed to be established by the lower vegetable
organisms.</p>

<p>Stem fruticose, erect, three to four feet in height; branches subglabrous or
slightly puberulent, angular; leaves lanceolate, short petiolate, cuneate, base
entire, triplinerved, apex acute with few remote teeth on the upper third, lamina
fleshy, varnished, subglabrous, minute glands scattering, slightly puberulent
chiefly beneath (two to three inches in length, about half an inch in breadth),

<p>This very minute species—often barely an inch or more in height—had
hitherto escaped our observation, until little friend George Bloomer discovered
it, while on a trip with us to the hills in this vicinity. The whole plant at
length often assumes a scarlet or purplish hue. It certainly is not the <i>C. violacea</i>
of D. C. and appears quite as distinct as any species known to us.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander made some remarks on the peculiar growth of
<i>Carex decidua</i>, in Marin County, not on the borders of the creeks,
but in the middle of them. He also spoke of <i>Hierochloa fragrans</i>
R. S., as a remarkably fragrant plant, and as furnishing beautiful
grass for lawns.</p>

<h3>On the Gradual Elevation of the Land in the Environs of
San Francisco.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.</p>

<p>The gradual elevation and depression of large portions of the earth’s surface
has, within the last few years, been attracting considerable attention from geologists.
It is a vast geological process of which we are the actual spectators,
offering us the most imposing terrestrial phenomenon of which we can be cognizant,
and at the same time affording us some tangible idea of the vast periods
that have been required for bringing the surface of the earth to its present
shape. It is the general opinion of geologists that the western shore of our
continent is gradually rising. This has been proved to be the case as regards
the southern portion of the continent; but the following facts, observed in the
neighborhood of this city, afford undoubted evidence that at least this portion
of the northern continent is being gradually elevated above the level of the
ocean.</p>

<p>On the northern bank of Lobos Creek, a small stream running from Mountain
Lake to the ocean, muscle shells and rolled pebbles are found at an elevation
of from eighty to one hundred feet above the present level of the ocean,
and probably at the distance of half a mile from the present beach. These
shells and pebbles are exactly analogous to those now being deposited at
the mouth of the creek, and were undoubtedly placed there when the spots
at which they are found formed the beach of the ocean. The surface of the
country is so much covered by drifting sands, that it is only in spots that
these shore remains show themselves. The deposits first seen contain remains
of shells considerably weathered—lower down the creek, shells and larger pebbles
are seen; still lower down I found the same materials mixed with smaller
pebbles, and at an elevation of about fifty feet small bands of black peat earth
were found interstratified with the sand and gravel. These small bands of vegetable
earth were evidently formed near the level of the ocean by the waves
throwing up a barrier of sand which dammed up the waters of the creek, so as
to form a pond in which a layer of vegetable matter was deposited. This
process is going on at the present time, a dam having been thrown up by the
heavy storms of the winter of 1861-1862.</p>

<p>Another evidence of the recent elevation of the country is seen near the
western end of the Puerta Suelo, at a distance of about eight miles from the
city. Here there is a depression in the hills, extending from the bay to the
ocean, and forming a narrow neck to the peninsula on which San Francisco
stands. Even at present, the distance from the waters of the bay to the ocean
is not more than two or three miles at this point, and it is evident that at no
very distant period this depression formed a channel of communication between
them. Near the western end of this former channel, and at about a mile inland
from the present sea beach, the skeleton of the head of a whale is found on the
surface of the ground. The specimen measures about six feet across, and must
have belonged to an animal fifty or sixty feet long. The bones, which are not
at all mineralised, are in a good state of preservation. At the time they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
carried there, there must have been eight or ten feet of water over the surface,
and as the place is at present from ten to fifteen feet above the level of the
ocean, a rise of twenty-five or thirty feet must have taken place at this spot
since the animal was washed there.</p>

<p>Another locality at which evidence of the gradual elevation of the land can
be obtained is found to the west of Black Point, where abundant remains of
our present bay shells are found at a considerable elevation above the level of
the sea; and, were not the surface of the country, particularly the lower levels,
so completely covered in by the drifting sands, no doubt many analogous deposits
could be found. To the south and west of the Mission, and in all the lower
levels between there and the range of hills overlooking the Puerta Suelo, the
surface is covered by these recent post tertiary deposits, through which the
older rocks protrude in many places as isolated masses, the recent argillaceous
sandstone being deposited in nearly horizontal strata around their base. These
sandstones have given rise, by their decomposition, to the extensive surfaces of
yellow sandy loam seen between the Mission and the Ocean House. I think the
highest of these beds does not attain a greater elevation than one hundred feet
above the present level of the ocean.</p>

<p>More recent evidence of the gradual elevation of the land is furnished by the
holes made by the marine worms in the rocks on the shores of the bay, many
of these holes being found at elevations which the highest tides do not at present
reach.</p>

<p>On the age of these deposits it is useless at present to speculate. All that we
know for certain is, that geologically speaking, they are recent; but whether it
is five hundred, or five thousand, or fifty thousand years since the present site
of Mountain Lake was on a level with the ocean, our present data do not enable
us to form an opinion. All that the facts prove is that this portion of the
continent is being gradually raised en masse.</p>

<p>From observations I have made on the main range of the Sierra, I am
inclined to think that this process of gradual elevation is not confined to the
land bordering the sea coast, but extends far into the interior. The undisturbed
position of the post tertiary strata on the western slope of the Sierra, would
indicate that the same process of gradual elevation must have been going on
for hundreds of thousands of years, so that the original beach of the earlier
post tertiary ocean is now at an elevation of four or five thousand feet above
the present level of the sea. Should subsequent observations confirm the truth
of this supposition, this country would afford a more striking example of the
action of existing causes in modifying the surface of the earth, than is to be
found in any other portion of the globe. It is desirable that some means should
be taken to ascertain and record accurately the present relative level of the sea
and land, as, after a few years, such a determination might furnish some very
useful geological data. I have no doubt that it will be found that every shock
of an earthquake is accompanied by an elevation of the land.</p>

taken:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Through the kindness of Mr. Edwards, I have had the opportunity of looking
at your two recent papers on <i>Argynnides</i> and on <i>Danais</i>, and have been
much interested therein. Reading the latter article, I instantly had recalled to
me some statements in regard to localization of the species at the Sandwich
Islands by the sons of one or two American missionaries long resident there—gentlemen
in every way to be depended on for common accuracy—by those
statements I was led to an opposite conclusion from yours in regard to the
means by which it was introduced; and since I have read your paper I have
met with Dr. Gulick, for some time a missionary at Ascension Island, one of
the Micronesian group, now in America for his health, from whom I have
received some additional facts. They all concur in stating that this butterfly
was formerly wanting at the Sandwich Islands, and spread over the Islands just
as fast as did the milk-weed upon which they feed—the two keeping pace with
one another. Dr. Gulick makes some more definite statements; he says that a
gentleman in Hawaii sent him on Ascension Island (2,000 or 3,000 miles distant)
a large box of plants under glass; that when they reached Ascension
Island he found among them the milk-weed, which was set out with others; in
five or six weeks they reached maturity, and then they discovered upon them
the larvæ of <i>Danais</i> which nearly destroyed them—the natives have never
before seen them and the butterfly was altogether unknown, indeed, no such
large and showy butterfly exists there. Subsequently and purposely, as an
experiment, he took some seeds to the opposite side of the Island, twenty-five
miles distant, and sowed them, and was absent some four or five months; when
he returned the larvæ were there. A gentleman and the natives had been put
upon the watch by him for the butterflies but none had been seen, and these
larvæ changing produced the first they had any of them seen.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that the appearance of the larvæ on the transported plant
in its early growth leaves but little room to doubt that the eggs of the insect
were transported also in the Wardian case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Prof. Whitney read the following notice of the large mass of
meteoric iron now in this city, on its way to the Smithsonian Institution:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>By a singular coincidence, we have now the pleasure of seeing in this city the
two great masses of meteoric iron which have been so often spoken of as being
at Tucson, in Arizona, one of which was brought here and presented to the
city by General Carleton, in November last, a notice of which, with an analysis,
has already appeared in our proceedings. This mass may properly be designated
as the “Carleton (Tucson) Meteoric Iron,” while the one which is destined
for the Smithsonian Institution may be called the “Ainsa (Tucson)
Meteoric Iron,” as it has been rendered accessible for scientific investigation by
Mr. Jesus M. Ainsa, as will be seen by the following memorandum of the circumstance
kindly furnished by his brother, Mr. James M. Ainsa:</p>

<p>“This aerolite was first discovered by the early Jesuit Missionaries in the
mountains called the ‘Sierra de la Madera,’ near Tucson.</p>

<p>“In 1735, El Capitan de las Provincias del Occidente, Don Juan Bautista
Anza, induced by the accounts of the science-loving Jesuits, ordered the aerolite
to be removed from the mountains, with the intention of sending it to Spain.
However, through the want of wagon roads and the proper means of conveyance
at that time, to take it to San Blas, then the nearest port of entry, the
attempt was entirely abandoned.</p>

<p>“The aerolite was left at Tucson, where it continued to attract the attention of
the scientific men who visited that country for more than a hundred years.
Since the acquisition of Arizona by the United States, greater notice has been
taken of this aerolite, it having been mentioned several times in the official
reports of the Government agents.</p>

<p>“By a singular coincidence, Augustin Ainsa, the great-grandson of Don Juan
Bautista Anza, undertook, in 1860, to transport the aerolite and present it to
the Smithsonian Institution. With great difficulty it was brought as far as
the Yñigo hacienda, where it remained until May, 1863, when Jesus M. Ainsa,
in his late visit to Sonora, brought it to this city, with the intention of forwarding
it to the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, where it will soon be
sent.”</p>

<p>At present the mass in question lies upon the steps of the Custom House,
where it has been most admirably photographed by Mr. Watkins.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It was said by Mr. Ainsa to weigh 1,600 pounds.</p>

<p>The shape of this meteoric mass is very peculiar; and, at first, it would
hardly be recognized as the identical specimen figured by Mr. Bartlett at
Tucson, especially as this gentleman estimated its weight at 600 pounds only.
Instead of being, as Mr. Bartlett supposed, a mass supported on two legs, it is,
in reality, a ring of metal, of very irregular dimensions, of which about one-quarter
was buried in the ground, in order to support it in a convenient position
for use as an anvil, when it was seen by him at Tucson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The dimensions of this ring are as follows:</p>

<table summary="Dimensions of the aerolite (ring of metal)">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Width of narrowest part</td>
    <td class="tdr">2¾</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The weight of the mass corresponds, taking the specific gravity at 7.2, with
a circle-ring, having an average width of one foot, and a thickness of a small
fraction less than eight inches—the diameter of the circle represented by the
exterior of the ring being assumed as four feet.</p>

<p>On examining with a magnifying glass a fractured surface of the mass, it was
seen at once to be different in composition from the Carleton Meteoric Iron, and
my conjecture that Prof. Smith was mistaken in supposing that he analyzed a
fragment from the mass figured by Mr. Bartlett, was confirmed.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is now
almost certain that Messrs. Brush and Smith did analyze fragments of the same
meteoric iron.</p>

<p>The Ainsa Meteoric Iron contains a large per centage of a white—almost
transparent—silicious mineral, having a vitreous lustre, which may be olivine;
but the amount seems larger than that in the Carleton mass. The Smithsonian
Institution will undoubtedly cause a chemical investigation to be made of this
superb meteoric mass, and it will be interesting to compare its composition with
that of the Carleton meteorite, as the two were found so near each other that
they may be supposed to have formed portions of the same body, and to have
fallen at the same time.</p>

<p>The photograph was taken by Mr. Watkins, at my request, partly to be sent
abroad as a specimen of the high degree of perfection which has been attained
by this gentleman in this department of art, and partly that an exact representation
might be secured of this very remarkable body, in case it should be
lost or captured on its way to Washington.</p>

<p>In concluding this notice, the following statement is given of all that is
known of the size and position of the masses of meteoric iron which have been
noticed by various travelers in Arizona and the adjacent portions of Mexico
and New Mexico.</p>

<p><i>In the Madera range</i>, “Sierra de la Madera,” between Tucson and Tubac,
“enormous masses of pure iron, some of which were transported to Tucson, and
for many years were to be seen in the Plaza of that Presidio.” Francisco
Velasco, in W. F. Nye’s Translation of his work on Sonora, p. 146, published
at San Francisco in 1861.—Two of these masses have been brought to this
city, the one weighing 1,600, the other 632 pounds; the question arises, how
many more are left in the Sierra Madera? To this, no answer can be given at
present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“At the <i>Hacienda de Concepcion</i>, on the road from Chihuahua to Rio Florida,”
a mass of meteoric iron estimated to weigh 3,853 lbs.—Bartlett. The
exact locality of this hacienda I have not been able to ascertain.</p>

<p>“<i>Ninety miles north-west of Santa Rosa</i>,” supposed to be the Santa Rosa in
the province of Coahuila, in Mexico, lat. 28°, long. 101° 30’; Ass’t A. Schott,
of the Mexican Boundary Survey, reports a large number of masses of meteoric
iron; see page 34, Part II, of Major Emory’s Report. This statement
needs confirmation.</p>

<p>“<i>Sancha Estate, some fifty or sixty miles from Santa Rosa, in the north of
Coahuila.</i>” This is the locality of the mass of meteoric iron, weighing 252
pounds, and now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, figured, described
and analyzed by Professor Smith; see Smithsonian Report for 1855, p.
154, and Silliman’s Journal, (2) XIX, 160. Professor Smith says, “various
accounts were given of the precise locality, but none seemed very satisfactory.”
It is not unlikely that this mass is from the same locality mentioned by Mr.

<p>“<i>Near the South-western edge of the Balson de Mapimi, on the route to the
Mines of Parral</i>, there is a meteorite, near the road, of not less than a ton
weight;” on the authority of Mr. Weidner, of the mines of Freiberg, as stated
by Professor Smith (Smithsonian Report for 1855, page 155), Mapimi is in
lon. 103° 30’; lat. 25° 45’ nearly.</p>

<p>“<i>At the Hacienda of Venagas</i>, there was (1827) a piece of iron that would
make a cylinder, one yard in length, with a diameter of ten inches. It was
said to have been brought from the mountains near the Hacienda.” Professor
Smith, on the authority of Dr. Berlandier (Smithsonian Report for 1855, p.
155), makes the above statement; the exact locality of the Hacienda I have
been unable to ascertain; it is probably nearly in lat. 24°, lon. 101°.</p>

<p><i>La Paz, New Mexico</i>, near the Colorado River, about lat. 33° 30’. A mass
of meteoric iron, weighing 10 pounds, was brought from that locality, in 1862,
by Mr. H. Ehrenberg.</p>

<p>A number of other localities of meteoric iron might be added from more
southern and central portions of Mexico; but as that is a region to which the
attention of Californian explorers and capitalists has not yet been much directed,
it will not be necessary to cite them here. It is hoped that the circulation of
the above list may be the means of procuring further information in regard to
the masses of iron noticed; and that, possibly, more of them may be brought
to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Scape short, naked, narrowly ancipital; leaves two, long linear-lanceolate,
acute, apex recurved, plain above, much attenuated towards the subterranean
base, which is somewhat canaliculate; lamina from five to ten-nerved, margins
remotely subscabrulose; flowers pale, purplish, about eight; umbel convex,
pedicels triangular, thickening upwards, about as long as the flowers, nerves of
the sepals distinctly purple to the tips; three outer sepals longer and broader,
erect, entire, oblong, somewhat obtuse, carinate; the three inner linear-lanceolate
sub-acute; genitals included, inner stamens slightly longer, anthers pale,
blueish, filaments simple, expanded at the base; style equal, stigma acute,
simple (or obsoletely lobed); capsule in outline obcordateley trigastric, embryo
granular (mature fruit not observed), appears to be somewhat substipitate, as
seen in the figure, the three cells somewhat grooved on the back; spathe persistent,
two-parted, ovate, sub-acute, about eleven-nerved, hyaline, and lilac
purple; bulb ovate, oblong, externally loosely coated with light-colored, smooth-nerved
membranaceous tunics. The scape is often found only an inch above
ground, as in the recent specimens from Mount Davidson by Mr. Herbert C.
Dorr. The leaves are two to three times the length of the scape. Our figure
is from a cultivated specimen furnished by Mr. H. G. Bloomer, from bulbs sent
us some years since by Mr. Andrew A. Veatch, from Washoe. This is the
largest form of it we have yet seen. The bulbs, however, under culture, are
often three or four times the size here represented. It has none of the garlic
odor so common in this genus.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>On New or Rare Mollusca Inhabiting the Coast of California.—No. II.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. G. COOPER, M.D.</p>

<p>The following species were collected while exploring for the State Geological
Survey, along the main land and islands bordering Santa Barbara channel, in
May, June, and July last. Besides those described as new, I obtained additional
specimens of some of those described in 1862, confirming the specific
characters then given, and to some extent establishing the generic more accurately.</p>

<p>Careful notes and drawings from living specimens furnish the basis of most
of the descriptions, together with examination of the specimens in alcohol.</p>

<p>With regard to localities, it must be noticed that “Santa Barbara” and
“Santa Barbara Island” are very distinct both in local characteristics and the
groups of animals inhabiting them. The island is about seventy-five miles from
the town, and thirty-five from the nearest main land. Catalina Island is twenty-four
miles from the main land, and very different in its molluscous animals
from both the main land and the other islands, being the richest locality on our
shores.</p>

<p>I have not been able to compare these species with those from South America
described by D’Orbigny and others; but, like our other littoral mollusca,
they are probably distinct. I have, however, found the pelagic species <i>Ommastrephes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
giganteus</i> D’Orb in large numbers, and “hundreds” of a species of
<i>Argonauta</i> washed ashore last spring as far north as Santa Cruz Island, as I
was informed by Dr. Shaw, who presented specimens to the State collection.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Aplysia</span> Linn.</h4>

<h5><i>A. californica</i> Cooper. State Collection, species 1045.</h5>

<p>Form and external appearance as usual in the genus. Length fifteen inches,
breadth five, height about the same. Color pale gray or greenish, becoming
purplish on the side, folds of mantle with scattered white specks, from which
an irregular network of brown lines extends over the rest of the body, interspersed
with large brown blotches. Inner surface of mantle varied with alternating
painted bars of white and dark brown interlocking together. Sole of
foot black. Eyes very minute and black.</p>

<p><i>Shell</i> contained in the substance of the mantle cartilaginous, translucent,
trapezoidal or hatchet-shaped, margins rounded, slightly convex above, the
nucleus or centre in old specimens distant from the posterior end or apex.
Faint radiating lines diverging from the nucleus, crossed by an irregular network
of darker lines, all ending abruptly at some distance from the margin,
which has thus a wide, nearly transparent border. An accessory plate arises
on the inner surface from the nucleus, spatulate in form and slightly raised.</p>

<p>The two younger specimens have the clear border and accessory plate less
developed, and very young ones do not probably show these characters at all,
but resemble the typical <i>Aplysia</i> in the form of the shell. On this account I
am unwilling to constitute it a new genus, but propose to call it a sub-genus
under the name of <span class="smcap">Neaplysia</span>.</p>

<p>There was no appearance of a multiplication of shells, said to occur in old
specimens of <i>Aplysia</i>. Not having any full description of the internal anatomy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of <i>Aplysia</i>, I cannot at present determine whether there are many other differences
in structure.</p>

<p>The stomach was full of large fragments of <i>Algæ</i>. I found three specimens
only, on the beach at San Pedro, July 25th, just after a heavy blow which
occurred at the lowest summer tides. Kept in water for some time, they
were very slow and uninteresting in movements, showing no evidence of any
means of defence except the exudation of a beautiful purple fluid from the
mantle when handled. This fluid, common to the Aplysiæ, though formerly
supposed to be poisonous and indelible, possesses no such properties, though it
may be a defence against marine animals which attack them.</p>

<p>The figure, taken from a tracing of the shell, and electrotyped by Dr. A.
Kellogg, represent the inner surface of the most developed specimen, of the
natural size.</p>

<p>One small specimen, dredged among seaweeds in ten fathoms, near the eastern
shore of the “Isthmus,” Catalina Island, shows no variation from those
obtained at San Diego.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Doris</span>, Linn.</h4>

<h5><i>D. albopunctata</i> Cooper. State Coll. Species 1000.</h5>

<p>Form ovate, pointed behind, flattened, surface shining, minutely rugose. Tentacles
club-shaped, retractile, branchial plume, 6-8 parted, bipinnately divided,
situated near the posterior extremity. Color yellow or orange brown, dorsal
surface thickly speckled with small white dots, each forming a slightly raised
papilla. Beneath paler.</p>

<p>Dredged from a rocky bottom in twenty fathoms, a mile from the shore at
Santa Barbara. Also found on rocks at low water mark near the north-west
end of Catalina Island.</p>

<p>Length about one inch, breadth one-third of an inch.</p>

<h5><i>Doris montereyensis</i> Cooper, Proc. Cal. Acad. II, 1862, p. 204.</h5>

<p>Found at Santa Barbara Island on rocks at low water, differing from the
original specimens only in larger size and deeper color. The tentacles are club-shaped,
the branchial 7-8 parted, bipinnate and from one opening.</p>

<h5><i>Doris sanguinea</i> Cooper, loc. cit. (<i>Asteronotus.</i>)</h5>

<p>Four specimens found with the last, differ from the type only in having the
black spots very small. The tentacles are acute, cylindro-conic, retractile into
a cavity bordered by a toothed membrane. The branchiæ form an erect chimney-shaped
expansion. I cannot discover the stellate valvular structure of the
branchial opening, which characterises the genus <i>Asteronotus</i>, in these specimens.</p>

<h5><i>Doris Sandiegensis</i> Cooper, loc. cit.</h5>

<p>Two found with the last agree exactly with specimens from San Diego. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tentacles are conical and acute. The branchial orifice does not present the peculiar
characters of <i>Actinocyclus</i>. Although all these species differ to some extent,
they have no characters to distinguish them generically from the typical <i>Doris</i>,
unless anatomical or microscopical examination should reveal them, or the
characters of that genus should be more closely limited.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Triopa</span> Johnston, 1838.</h4>

<h5><i>T. catalinæ</i> Cooper. State coll. species, 1002.</h5>

<p>Form much elongated, narrow, dorsal surface flat, becoming spatulate posteriously.
Head expanded laterally and flattened, wider than the body, ornamented
with 14 ciliæ, equally distributed around its margin, so as to form nearly
a circle. Tentacles long, conical, retractile. Three pairs of short ciliæ at
equal distances apart between the tentacles and middle of the body, connected
by the sharp edges of the dorsal surface. Branchial plume five parted, bipinnately
divided, expanding to nearly twice the width of the body, situated a
little behind the middle of the body. Two short ciliæ close together on the
medium line, a little behind the branchiæ. Length 1.50, breadth 0.25 inch.
Color yellowish, speckled with white, filaments vermilion red.</p>

<p>Four specimens found on sea weed among rocks at low water near north end
of Catalina Island, June 16th.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dendronotus</span> Alder and Hancock, 1845.</h4>

<h5><i>D. iris</i> Cooper. State coll. species 959.</h5>

<p>Pale purple, varying to orange red, foot narrowly edged with white, tentacles
with white tips and a subterminal orange ring, branchial processes purple, the
smaller ones sometimes olive near the base. Length of largest specimens 3,
breadth 0.50 inch.</p>

<p>Several found on the beach at Santa Barbara, May 5th, having been washed
ashore by an unusually heavy sea, occurring at a very low stage of the tide.
One, also, dredged on seaweed, from a depth of 28 fathoms, two miles off shore.</p>

<p>This species seems more variable in color than the other <i>nudibranchiata</i> of
this coast, but I saw no reason for considering them of more than one species.
Those washed ashore being somewhat injured, although still alive, I made no
drawing of them, and the more perfect one dredged was too small for this purpose.</p>

<p>In the “Mollusca and Shells,” of the U. S. Exploring Expedition under
Commodore Wilkes, Dr. Gould mentions a species of Dendronotus collected at
Puget Sound, but does not name it or give any clue to its characters, except
that the <i>branchiæ</i> have white tips, unlike our specimens. It is very probable,
however, that it belongs to the same species, as so many of the Mollusca of
this coast have an equally wide range.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Æolis</span> Cuvier, 1798.</h4>

<h5><i>Æ. barbarensis</i> Cooper. State coll. species 978.</h5>

<p>Rose-red, longer tentacles tipped with yellow, branchial ciliæ simple, in six
longitudinal rows, all short, the middle rows longest and tipped with blue, anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tentacles two, above the mouth, dorsal tentacles club-shaped, a white streak
extending from the median line between them to the mouth. Length nearly an
inch.</p>

<p>One specimen dredged on a rocky bottom, in a depth of 16 fathoms, a mile
from the shore at Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Although small, its characters are too different from those of our other species,
when of the same size, to allow us to consider it the young of any of them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Flabellina</span> Cuvier, 1830.</h4>

<h5><i>F. opalescens</i> Cooper.<br />
<i>Syn.</i> Æolis, (Flabellina?) opalescens, Cooper—Proc. Cal. Acad. II, 1862,
p. 205.</h5>

<p>This species, dredged from the same locality as the last, presented exactly the
same characters as the original specimens from San Diego. I also found a few
of them on the rocky shore of Santa Barbara Island, differing only in having
the branchial olive, tipped with white.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Phidania</span> Gray, 1850.</h4>

<h5><i>P. iodinea</i>, Cooper—<i>Syn.</i> Æolis (Phidania?), iodinea, Cooper, loc. cit. sup.</h5>

<p>I found one of this species on the beach at Santa Barbara, agreeing exactly
with those from San Diego.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chioræra</span> Gould, 1855.</h4>

<h5><i>C. leonina</i> (?) Gould—Molluscs and Shells, U. S. Expl. Exped.</h5>

<p>Wholly translucent, pale yellow, the variations marked only by a darker
shade. Form of head nearly conical, the apex anterior, forming an angular
roof above the oral opening. Bronchial processes five on each side, larger than
represented in Gould’s figure, imbricated and decumbent. Length 2.75, height
1 inch. Otherwise as in the description and figure of Gould’s specimen.</p>

<p>A single specimen dredged in 20 fathoms off Santa Barbara, May 15th, differs
in the points above mentioned from the northern animal, but being much
smaller, the differences may arise from immaturity, and I have therefore preferred
to retain the same name for it.</p>

<p>The single specimen which formed the type of the genus was dredged in
Puget Sound, was over five inches long and of various bright colors, the head
subglobose, higher than oral opening, branchiæ in six pairs, comparatively
smaller and erect, all of which differences may have arisen from more perfect
development, and from having been observed under more favorable conditions.</p>

<p>From its rarity on our southern coast we may expect to find it more abundant
northward.</p>

<h3>Description of a New Species of Alsine.</h3>

<p class="center">BY A. KELLOGG, M.D.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Alsine</span> Wahlenb.</h4>

<h5><i>A. palustre</i> Kellogg.</h5>

<p>Plant slender, somewhat decumbent at the base, simple or slightly branching
at the summit, glabrous, sulcate on opposite sides of the stem, sub-flexuous,
six inches to a foot in height. Leaves lance-linear, acute, mucronate, glabrous,
margins scabrous, sub-connate and slightly sheathing at the membranous base,
shorter than the internodes (half to more than an inch in length). Peduncles
slightly compressed, axillary, solitary, long, naked. Sepals ovate-lanceolate,
acute or subacute, one to three-nerved, green with scarious margins, about half
the length of the petals. Petals white, oblanceolate, obtuse, entire. Stamens
ten, subequal, short. Styles three; stigmas deeply biparted.</p>

<p>A plant very abundant in swamps in this vicinity, known to us for the last
ten years, but as we find no description which we recognize, we conclude it
must be unknown. Blossoming in July and August. Specimens by Mr.
Bolander.</p>

<h3>On a New Genus of Terrestrial Mollusca Inhabiting California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. G. COOPER, M.D.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Binneya</span> Cooper.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h4>

<p><i>Generic characters.</i>—General form of animal like <i>Limax</i>, with a shell resembling
that of <i>Omalonyx</i> or <i>Lamellaria</i>.</p>

<p>Body about three times as long as shell, semicylindrical, obtuse in front, forming
an acute angle behind; foot extending the whole length, somewhat distinct
anteriorly, and carinate behind. Mantle shield-like, covering the back anterior
to the shell for about one-fourth its length, not reflected over the shell. Eye-peduncles
moderate, slender, two short acute tentacles in front of head. Lingual
teeth resembling those of Helix in form and arrangement.</p>

<p>Shell entirely external, ear-shaped, nearly flat, about one-third as long as the
animal, which it does not half cover when retracted. Spire flattened, forming
two horizontal volutions, last whorl enormously expanded and slightly arched.
Columella distinct, entire, hiding the interior of the convolutions.</p>

<h5><i>Binneya notabilis</i> Cooper. State Coll. Species 988.</h5>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—Animal dark lead-colored, with black reticulations, and
a wide brown stripe along the median line, extending from the mantle to the
front of head, about one-fourth of the total length.</p>

<p>Shell with a pale brown, smooth and shining epidermis, extending beyond
the margin, translucent when young, becoming thickened by an opaque white
deposit on the interior when old. First whorl or nucleus ornamented with
about thirty delicate parallel revolving ribs, not concealed by the epidermis, and
ending abruptly at the commencement of the transverse lines of growth in the
body whorl.</p>

<p>Length 0.46, breadth 0.34, height 0.12 inch.</p>

<p>This genus resembles <i>Limax</i> in its shield-like mantle, but in the more essential
characters of the lingual teeth, appears to belong undoubtedly to the <i>Helicidæ</i>.
It approaches nearest to the subfamily <i>Vitrininæ</i>, in having the mantle
in front of the shell, approaching nearest to the <i>Daudebardia</i> of Europe; but
differs in the form and opacity of the shell, which resembles some of the <i>Succininæ</i>,
especially <i>Omalonyx</i> of South America, etc. It differs from these very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
much in the form of the animal, and the shell being wholly external, forming
one of those connecting links which make it difficult or impossible to divide the
<i>Helicidæ</i> into distinct groups.</p>

<p><i>Habitat.</i> So far this animal has been found only in Santa Barbara Island,
one of the group within this State. It there inhabits but one station, so far as
I could discover after very careful search. That is the head of a ravine facing
the south-east and about two hundred and fifty feet above the sea. During the
wet season there may be a little water springing from this place, but for at least
five months it is not even damp, while the remainder of the island is entirely
destitute of water. Myriads of <i>Helix kelletii</i> and two other species (probably
new) inhabit it, but during the dry season retire into a torpid æstivation, not
disturbed by the fogs and mists of summer. The <i>Binneya</i>, the rarest of all,
and not protected from drought by its shell, burrows down to the under surface
of thick succulent roots, and contracting to about twice the size of its shell,
covers the rest of its body with a white mucous secretion, which appears to be
impervious to the moisture within, and dries into a tough leathery shell.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> When
moistened for a few hours, the animal separates the edge of this box from that
of its true shell, and becomes active.</p>

<p>The figures [<a href="#fig15">Fig. 15</a>] represent three positions of the shell, the animal æstivating
and also crawling.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Descriptions of New Species of Fishes.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ANDREW GARRETT, OF HONOLULU, S. I.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Julis</span> Cuv.</h4>

<h5><i>Julis ornatissimus</i> Garrett.</h5>

<p class="center">D. 9-13; A. 2-13; V. 1-5; P. 12; C. 2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 2.</p>

<p>The body of this <i>Julis</i> is rich green, which gradually passes into light blue
on the breast and belly. The scales on the green ground are margined with
vermillion red, and there is a slight tinge of the latter color on the abdominal
scales. Four alternate oblique light red and blue vittæ pass from the middle
of the gill-opening, and gradually fade away beneath the anterior portion of the
abdomen. The head, which is emerald green, is ornamented with vermillion red
stripes, which have their margins shaded off with brilliant blue. The stripes are
disposed as follows: one traverses the upper line of profile, two extend from the
upper lip to the eye, one follows the lower line of the head, passing up the
hinder margin of the gill covers; two horizontal ones on the cheek, and, posteriously
to the eye they assume reticulations. Irides golden yellow, with shades
of light red; cornea dusky green. The dorsal, anal and caudal fins are carmine
red, margined with pale blue. The former with a basal row of large spots, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
an intramarginal band, dark green. Two similar bands mark the outer half of
the anal fin, and spots of the same color may be observed on the caudal. The
ventrals are pale, straw-yellow, with blue, anterior margins. Pectorals have a
pale, yellow tinge at their base.</p>

<p>The greatest depth of the body, as compared to the entire length of the fish,
is about one to four. The scales are rather large. The head constitutes a little
less than a fourth of the total length. In addition to the usual teeth which
characterize the genus, we observe a spiniform tooth projecting obliquely forward
from the posterior portion of the branches of the upper jaw. The caudal
fin is posteriorly rounded off, and the ventrals are long and pointed.</p>

<p>Length, 4½ inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—We have observed only a single example of this very rare and
beautiful fish, which was captured at the island of Hawaii in 1856. Its peculiar
markings will readily distinguish it from any of the numerous species inhabiting
our coasts. In shape and markings of the head it resembles <i>Julis
pæcila</i>, figured in the Zoology of the Voyage of the “Blossom,” but the colors
of the body and fins are widely different.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chironectes</span> Cuv.</h4>

<h5><i>Chironectes rubro-fuscus</i> Garrett.</h5>

<p class="center">D. 3-13; A. 9; V. 6; P. 11; C. 9.</p>

<p>A single example of this species now before me has been preserved in spirits
several years. It is in fine condition, though the colors are much faded. The
general shape is oblong-oval, and much compressed. The thickness at the base
of the head enters about five and a half times in the total length. The whole
surface is covered with crowded minute hispid asperities, and very small, remote,
cutaneous, tuft-like appendages. The head, as viewed in profile, is irregularly
rounded, the chin forming the anterior end, being slightly in advance of the
mouth. The eyes are exceedingly small, elliptically oval in shape, their greatest
diameter being only three-twentieths of an inch. Their distance from the margin
of the upper jaw is five times their own length. The mouth is vertical. On
the top of the snout, midway between the eyes and the end of the upper jaw, is
a long setaceous appendage, articulated to a tubercle, and tufted at the end.
On the cranium there are two stout, curved processes, which project posteriorly,
the hind one the largest, and both enveloped in the integuments. The dorsal
fin takes its origin at a point corresponding to the middle of the total length of
the fish, caudal exclusive. Its height equals the length of its own base. The
caudal trunk and fin are slightly oblique to the horizontal axis of the body.
The anal fin is small and rounded off along its outer margin. The rays in all
the fins have their ends slightly prolonged in little fleshy points. The color, as
noted from the living fish, is dark red, with irregular, cloud-like markings and
spots, dusky gray. Everywhere maculated with small, irregular, dusky spots,
which are the most numerous on the belly. A few deep black maculations on
the vertical fins and scattering ones on the body. The interior of the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and tongue are mottled with red and white. Irides pale flesh color; cornea
black. The smooth inner surfaces of the pectoral and ventral fins are intensely
red.</p>

<p>Length, 8½ inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—This fine large species is very rare. As compared with the <i>C.
leprosus</i> from the same location, it is much larger, more compressed, the eyes
much smaller and the ground color is quite different. In the <i>leporina</i> the eyes
are less than twice their own diameter distant from the anterior margin of the
upper jaw. In our fish they are five diameters distant from the same point.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chætodon</span> L.</h4>

<h5><i>Chætodon multicinctus</i> Garrett.</h5>

<p class="center">D. 13-24; A. 3-19; V. 1-5; P. 14; C. 3, 1, 8, 7, 1, 2.</p>

<p>Form oval. The head enters about four and a half times in the total length.
The upper line of profile from the snout to the dorsal fin is nearly straight,
rising at an angle of 60°. The snout is short. The eye is large, circular, its
diameter one-third of the length of the head, and placed just midway between
the opercular corner and the end of the snout. The preopercular margin exhibits
a few small dentations. The scales are moderate size.</p>

<p>The dorsal and anal fins are posteriorly rounded off. The hinder margin of
the caudal is truncate. The anterior soft ray of the ventrals is slightly prolonged
beyond the margin of the fin.</p>

<p>Color creamy-yellow. The sides are marked with five vertical, yellowish-brown,
diffuse stripes, the two anterior ones terminate on the side of the belly,
and the others at the base of the anal fin. There is a slight indication of a
sixth one along the basal half of the soft portion of the dorsal fin. Each scale
is marked with a faint, yellowish-brown dot. A yellow line starts from a point
above the base of the ventral, follows the line of the belly, and unites with a
black one which traverses the anal fin. A blue black spot in front of the
dorsal fin gradually passes into the ocular fascia, the latter being brown above
and yellow beneath the eye. Irides chrome-yellow. Upper lip brown. A
vertical black stripe, shaded off anteriorly with vermillion, marks the middle of
the caudal trunk. The dorsal spines and filaments are orange-yellow, the inter-radial
membrane is colorless. The soft portion of the dorsal and anal are
ochre-yellow along their middle-third, the former with a broad yellow and the
latter with a pale greenish margin. The two colors on either fin separated by a
narrow black and white line. The caudal is colorless, with a basal vertical
luniform bar, its convex margin anterior. The ventrals are whitish, and the
pectorals colorless.</p>

<p>Length, 3½ inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—Two examples of this species were procured in Honolulu market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ophisurus</span> Lac.</h4>

<h5><i>Ophisurus Californiensis</i> Garrett.</h5>

<p>This <i>Ophisurus</i> is more robust than usual in species of this genus. The head
is large, swollen beneath, and comprises about one-twelfth of the entire length.
The depth, taken at the origin of the anal fin, enters about twenty-eight times
in the total length, or twice in the length of the head. The pectorals are large,
elliptical in shape, their tips reaching posteriorly nearly as far as the origin of
the dorsal fin. The dorsal and anal fins are well developed, the latter passing
over a base considerably more than half the length of the fish.</p>

<p>The color in spirits is brown, paler on the lower half of the head, and
cinereous along the throat and belly. A dorsal row of large, roundish, brownish-black
spots extends from the occipital region to the end of the tail; the
spots being intersected by the fin, and the two anterior ones are saddle shaped.
A second row, disposed alternately to the first, occupies the upper half of the
flanks. The head is irregularly maculated, the spots becoming paler beneath.
The fins are light, brownish-grey; the dorsal and anal with a narrow darker
margin, which is articulated with dark brown.</p>

<p>Length, 19½ inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Lower California.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—The specimen described above, was captured at Margarita Bay,
by Mr. White, of the whaler Rambler, to whom I am indebted for a valuable
collection of objects of natural history.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Ayres remarked that he had recently received from Tomales
Bay specimens of an ichthyic type, new to this coast, and probably
new to science. The species is closely allied to <i>Scomberesox</i>, though
the jaws are but moderately elongated. It is judged worthy of record,
even previous to any description, since no fish of that group
has hitherto been found in the waters of California. The specimens
exhibited to the Academy were from five to eight inches in length.
He also gave notice of the acquisition of a specimen of Thrasher,
taken in the Bay of San Francisco. The species is a very close
representative of the Atlantic form <i>Alopias vulpes</i>, differing, however,
in the proportions of the dorsal and anal fins, and in the position
of the branchial apertures; the tail constitutes decidedly more
than half of the entire length. The specimen is about five feet in
length.</p>

<p>Dr. Ayres presented a specimen of Barnacles, found floating at
sea in lat. 33° 8´ N., lon. 129° 35´ W., by Capt. Geo. Goodrum of
San Francisco. They were of the <i>Anatifa</i> type, but exhibited the
remarkable feature of being attached, not to some extraneous substance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
as a fragment of wreck, for instance, but to a spherical,
fleshy receptacle, apparently a portion of their own system. This
receptacle was of a light, yellowish color, about the size of a small
orange, which it somewhat resembled in aspect. To it were attached,
by the usual flexible pedicles, about a dozen Barnacles,
allied to <i>Anatifa</i>, as above indicated, but differing from it in the
breadth of the dorsal plate, and in the projection of a strong keel
at the base of both dorsal and lateral plates. When this specimen
was procured, myriads like it covered the sea for miles in the track
of the vessel. Barnacles aggregated in this manner of growth do
not appear to have been hitherto reported.</p>

<p class="center">President in the Chair.</p>

<p>Seven members present.</p>

<p>A donation to the cabinet of several species of fishes from the
Sandwich Islands was received from Mr. Andrew Garrett.</p>

<p>Donation to the Library:</p>

<p>Fragmenta Phytographiæ Australiæ, by Ferdinand Mueller,
Vol. III, from the author.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander stated that he had recently collected two grasses
believed not to have been before found on this coast, though common
in the Atlantic States, viz.: <i>Paspalum distichum</i> (L.) along
the shores of Clear Lake, covering large patches of ground, and
<i>Leersia oryzoides</i> (Swartz), along Cache Creek, of much larger
size than he had met with in the East. He believed <i>Gastridium
australe</i>, which covers almost every dry hill in the interior, to be
indigenous.</p>

<p>Dr. Behr made some remarks on the date of introduction of some
foreign plants, now becoming very common in this vicinity, which
he intends to make the subject of a future article.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper exhibited specimens of <i>Lagomys princeps</i>, the “Little
Chief Hare,” from the summits of the Sierra Nevada. He remarked
that this rare animal lived about the limits of perpetual snow, and
was so rarely seen that residents for several years near its resorts
had never seen it. He found it quite common in a very limited
district, though difficult to obtain, from its extreme shyness. Though
before found in the Rocky Mountains near South Pass, and Salt
Lake, where it is called “Coney,” this was the first record of its
occurrence so far to the west and south.</p>

<h3>On new Genera and Species of California Fishes—No. I.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. G. COOPER, M.D.</p>

<p>The fishes described in the following articles were collected by me for the
State Geological Survey, along the Southern Coast of this State and among
the adjoining islands. While it is possible that some of them may have been
described in works not now accessible to us, the probabilities are entirely in
favor of their being new, as we have very recent lists of all the species described
as inhabitants of this Coast since the report on fishes collected by the
Pacific Rail Road Surveys.</p>

<p>For much information and assistance in their determination, I am indebted
to Dr. W. O. Ayres, and also to Dr. George Hewston, for the use of books not
contained in any public library in the city.</p>

<p>The outline illustrations, reduced from accurate measurements, were electrotyped
and presented by our industrious collaborator, Dr. Kellogg.</p>

<p>The colors described are in all cases those of the living fish.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Dekaya</span>, n. g.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>

<p><i>Generic characters.</i>—General shape elongated and fusiform, head small and
short, premaxillaries slightly protractile, eye large, situated above the level of
mouth, profile moderately sloping, snout broad and obtuse.</p>

<p>Preoperculum serrated behind, operculum with one obtuse spine; branchiostegal
rays five on each side. Opercular openings connected below.</p>

<p>Front rows of teeth on premaxillaries small, conical, acute, and slightly
recurved; those of upper jaw largest, their size decreasing from the middle
towards each angle, where there are one or two large canines; those below hidden
by the upper jaw. Behind this row in both jaws, a band of velvet teeth
in about six irregular rows near the symphysis, but ending entirely near the
middle of each ramus. Tongue and vomer toothless. Pharyngeal bones and
branchial arches densely crowded with large velvet teeth.</p>

<p>Infraorbital bone short, curving up under posterior border of orbit, and not
connected with the operculum.</p>

<p>Nostrils double, anterior opening smaller, lips rather thick and fleshy.</p>

<p>Scales small, numerous, oblong, subquadrangular, finely pectinated, covering
the whole body and head as far as front of orbit, but leaving a bare space
around the eye.</p>

<p>Fins scaleless, as well as caudal rays. Dorsal and anal fins very long at
base; spinous rays few. Lateral line normal.</p>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—Length of head contained five times in total length. Distance
from end of snout to orbit one-third the length of head, and greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
width of orbit. Height of head just behind orbit about equal to distance from
tip of snout to edge of preoperculum; breadth one-third to one-half of its
length. Skin on occiput elevated from the bone by a thick layer of fat, not
by any bony expansions.</p>

<p>Height of pectoral fin less than length of head; its width about one-third
of its height, middle rays longest.</p>

<p>Dorsal arising above pectoral joint, its length one-third that of the fish; first
spine one-ninth the length of the fin; the other spines lengthening to the commencement
of the soft portion, of which the longest ray is one-fifth the length of
the fin, and the last ray one-fifteenth; the entire fin having a gradually arching
outline.</p>

<p>Caudal moderately broad, deeply forked, and acutely pointed; the upper
lobe slightly the largest.</p>

<p>Anal similar in form to dorsal, arising opposite its eighth soft ray and prolonged
a little farther back. It is three-fifths as long as dorsal, its height about
one-fourth its length, the first (spinous) ray and the last each half as long as
the longest.</p>

<p>Ventrals four-fifths the height of pectorals, arising immediately behind them;
their width one-third of their length.</p>

<p class="center">D. VII, 23-2, C 3-1-6-6-1-3, A I-2-21-2, P 6-1-11, V, I-1-1-3. Scales 175, 13/32-10/10.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—Pale silvery brown, white below; an obscure row of brown spots
and mottlings on sides; fins and tail olive near base; iris dark brown and gilt.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>—This fish seems to be a very aberrant form of the Percoid family,
having many of the characters of other orders. Its general form and dentition are
those of some Sciaenoids, while its entire dorsal, opercular armature and only five
branchiostegals separate it both from them and the Percoids. The very long
anal is another character found in few if any members of these families. I can
find nothing in the pharyngeal bones to indicate its affinities, these being closely
like those of both the above families as shown in <i>Seriphus politus</i> and <i>Paralabrax
clathratus</i>, which on comparison have them almost exactly similar.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Heterognathodon</i>, of Bleeker, has several of the most peculiar characters
of this one; but not having a full description of it, I cannot compare them.
There are generic differences at least, and the habitat is widely different, being
the East Indies. Richardson places it with other aberrant genera in the family
<i>Theraponidae</i>—(<i>Datninae</i>, of Swainson,) which is probably a mixture of several.</p>

<p>The outline figure represents the fish one-third the natural size; 22 inches.</p>

<p>This fish is caught rather plentifully in autumn at Catalina Island, where I
obtained the one here described, in October, 1861. During my late visit there,
in June and July, none would bite, and I have not yet obtained any duplicates.
It is called by the very vague name of “White-fish.”</p>

<p>The figure being made from a skin may be a little inaccurate in proportions;
but I hope to be able to present a better one in the Report of the Geological
Survey.</p>

<p>This white-fish is not remarkable for excellence as food.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ayresia</span>, n. g.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h4>

<p><i>Generic characters.</i>—Form elongated, suboval; the outline more curved above
than below. Scales large, finely pectinated, completely covering the body and
head, except in front of orbit; smaller on head, and becoming very small where
they extend over parts of the fins and tail.</p>

<p>Teeth numerous, acute, entire, the anterior row largest; those below larger
than above, and flattened posteriorly. A few smaller ones crowded behind these
near symphysis. Pharyngeals villiform.</p>

<p>Premaxillars protractile, the upper arched, twice as high as wide, the lower
shutting within it.</p>

<p>Preoperculum entire, a very small obtuse spine at angle of operculum.</p>

<p>Pectorals rather long and pointed. Caudal deeply forked, the lobes acute.
Dorsal long, anal moderate.</p>

<p>Differs from <i>Pomacentrus</i> (Lacepede) chiefly in a more arched dorsal outline,
armed operculum and unarmed preoperculum, pointed fins and tail, proportions
of fins.</p>

<p>The dorsal outline appears to become much more convex with age, chiefly
from deposit of fat on the occiput, as is the case in some Labroids, as for
instance, <i>L. pulcher</i> (Ayres) and <i>Julis modestus</i> (Girard), the latter also growing
higher in proportion to its length throughout. The dotted line represents
the dorsal outline of a specimen one-fourth larger than that figured, but otherwise
closely like it.</p>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—Head forming less than a fourth of total length (0.18),
eyes less than one-third the length of head, and less than its own diameter from
end of snout, height of head behind orbit about equal to its length. Greatest
thickness of body about one-eighth of total length.</p>

<p>Height of pectoral equal to one-fourth the distance from snout to fork of tail
(0.21). Dorsal commencing above pectoral joint, its spinous portion nearly
one-third of its total length, and one-sixth of its height, the first spine shortest.
Soft rays becoming three times as high, forming an obtuse point behind; the
last ray about as long as the spines (the first dorsal spine should be one-fourth
longer than in the figure). Caudal peduncle slightly contracted, shorter than
caudal rays. Fork of tail extending half-way to its base, the upper lobe longest,
being one-fifth of the total length. Anal commencing beneath the tenth dorsal
spine, and ending a little anterior to end of soft dorsal, its base less than one-sixth
of total length (0.17).</p>

<p class="center">Br. V-V D.XIII, 6-1-6, C. 3-1-6 6-1-3, A.II-11, V. I-8, P-19. Scales 30 3/8 4/9 3/3
lat. line ant. 19.</p>

<p><i>Color.</i>—Bluish or greenish-black; sides, paler, sometimes coppery, fins smoky,
the dorsal and caudal spotted with black, iris bronzed brown. Beneath whitish
in young, all the hues darker in the old fish. Some are also spotted on the
body posteriorly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In the winter of 1861-2, I caught several in San Diego Bay, which bit freely
at the usual baits. I did not hear any peculiar name applied, but they are
confounded with “Perch,” which they little resemble. Also found at San
Pedro.</p>

<p>A larger one, taken in a net at Santa Barbara Island, in May, 1863, has the
different characters supposed to indicate an older fish, and is much fatter; its
head is also shorter in proportion, but as I find a similar difference in specimens
of <i>Girella nigricans</i> Ayres, as well as in the Labroids before mentioned, I must
consider these as sexual differences, or in part depending on age and condition.
They do not differ more than some specimens of <i>Embiotoca jacksoni</i> from each
other, and agree closely in the number of spines and rays of their fins.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—General profile elliptical, height of body nearly one-quarter
its length, breadth about half the height.</p>

<p>Head laterally compressed, somewhat flattened on top, the nose horizontally
rounded, but laterally pointed. Base of tail vertically compressed, one-third
broader than it is high. Head half the length of body, its height behind orbit
equal to half its length. Diameter of orbit one-sixth the length of head, its
form obliquely oval. Jaws equal, gape of mouth one-third the length of head.</p>

<p>Pectoral fin, arising at middle of vertical of side, nearly half the total length,
its width at base one-eighth of its length, but suddenly narrowing to one-fifteenth,
which width it retains nearly to the end, its outer third curving gradually
downward, and becoming pointed. First dorsal commencing directly above
pectoral, its length nearly one-fourth of total length, and its height in front two-fifths
of its length. Spines rapidly decreasing in length from the first to the
eighth, the next six about equal, and a third of the first, the last one very short.
Second dorsal immediately behind the first and a little higher, triangular, nearly
one-third higher than long, its base lengthened posteriorly, and one-third the
length of the first dorsal. Finlets eight above and eight below, acutely triangular,
those near the middle a little larger.</p>

<p>Caudal large, its lobes equal, their length three times their width, and one-third
that of the pectoral; posterior outline arcuately concave, with slightly widened
lobes near the middle.</p>

<p>Anal opposite end of second dorsal, similar to it in form, but smaller, and
about twice as high as long, its position half way between the ventrals and
caudal. Its first spine is only about one-third as long as the second, which is
two-thirds the height of fin; both concealed by the skin.</p>

<p>Ventrals arising opposite second dorsal spine, about twice as high as wide,
their inner margin with a small pointed lobe.</p>

<p>Cartilaginous ridge on side of caudal peduncle moderate, highest anteriorly,
its length half that of caudal lobe. Two slight oblique ridges behind the median
ridge.</p>

<p>Lateral line imperceptible in front of fourth dorsal spine, parallel with outline
of back. No scales on head. Thoracic corselet of very large consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
scales above pectoral, bordered by six rows of large distinct scales, which
grow smaller from before backwards. Scales underneath ventrals and around
other fins, similarly consolidated, and depressed under pectoral and ventral.
Rest of scales nearly uniform in size.</p>

<p>Teeth numerous, very small, in one row, the palatine dense and velvety.
Rays of second dorsal and anal fins nearly hidden by adipose skin.</p>

<p class="center">Br. VI-VI D.XIV-12-|-8, P 32, V, I-8 A.II-8,-|-8 C.11-1-6-6-1-12.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—Above blackish, sides steel-blue, below silvery white, fins smoky, iris
brown, finlets yellow edged with blue.</p>

<p>The largest I saw measured thirty-three inches to fork of tail, and weighed
twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>Numerous in summer among the islands off the southern coast of this State,
and is said to occur as far north as San Luis Obispo. It affords excellent sport,
being caught by trolling while sailing very rapidly, biting voraciously at a
white rag. It is in my opinion the best fish for the table that is caught on
this coast, but it is said to be sometimes poisonous.</p>

<p>It belongs to the typical <i>Orcynus</i> of Cuvier, distinguished from <i>Thynnus</i>, by
the very long pectoral, eight pairs of finlets, small corselet, etc. The type of
<i>Orcynus</i> (Scomber alatunga, Linn., or O. alalonga, Duhamel), is called “Ala
longa” (Long-wing) in the Mediterranean and resembles this species closely,
but is figured as less high and with a smaller pectoral fin.</p>

<p>This species is one of several confounded by sailors under the Spanish names
of Albicore and Bonito. The English name Tunny is applied to an allied
species on the coast of Europe, the <i>Thynnus vulgaris</i>, Cuv., and to its near
representative the <i>T. secundi-dorsalis</i>, Storer, of the eastern American coast.
These, however, are evidently of a different genus, and as <i>Thynnus</i> is preoccupied
in insects, the name <i>Orcynus</i>, applied by Gill to the same type, may perhaps
be retained, although <i>founded on a mistake</i>. <i>O. coretta</i>, Cuv. and Val.,
probably represents our species in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Enumeration of Shrubs and Trees growing in the vicinity of
the mouth of San Francisco Bay.</h3>

<p class="center">BY HENRY N. BOLANDER.</p>

<p>The territory in question is divided naturally into three parts:</p>

<p>1. The northern part of the peninsula of San Francisco, with an undulating
and hilly surface, consists of drifting sand, with a small per centage of humus
mingled with it.</p>

<p>2. The Oakland Hills, running N. 54° W. mag., from the Bay of San Pablo
to San Leandro, a distance of twenty-three miles, with the adjacent slopes and
valleys. Heavy clayey soil predominates; but where shrubs and trees grow it is
mostly a loose, light, and slightly sandy soil.</p>

<p>3. That part of Marin County between San Rafael, the head of Tomales Bay
and Bolinas Bay, forming a triangle, with a hilly surface, the ridges running
N. 54° W. mag. Soil a heavy clay, in the valleys and on bare hills; or a
light, slightly sandy loam among shrubs and trees.</p>

<p>In all parts a metamorphic sand-stone underlies the soil.</p>

<h3>On Californian Lepidoptera—No. III.</h3>

<p class="center">BY H. BEHR, M. D.</p>

<p>The following species of butterflies were mostly collected by the members of
the State Geological Survey, among the higher regions of the Sierra Nevada;
but some of them are from other portions of California.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Danais</span>, Latr.</h4>

<h5>1. <i>Danais Archippus</i>, Cramer.</h5>

<p>This species was found everywhere, both on the plains and at the highest
elevations, up to the limits of Lepidopterous life, 10,500 feet above the level
of the sea. The specimens caught in the Sierra were in a poor condition, and
differed remarkably in habits from those found near San Francisco Bay. Like
most Danaids, ours is rather a lazy and heavy butterfly, gifted it is true with
great power of flight, which is shown not by swiftness, but by perseverance.
It is however quite easily caught. But according to the statement of Mr.
Hoffman, of the Geological Survey, this same Danais was on the mountain
summits so restless and active that although very common, only two specimens
could be obtained.</p>

<p>We consider these specimens as something like “enfans perdus,” of an otherwise
respectable family, led away by an innate desire to strive against the
current. Thus they struggle against the mountain breeze until finally they
reach the bleak heights of the Sierra, where such tropical forms contrast strikingly
with the alpine flora.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Argynnis</span>, Fabr.</h4>

<h5>2. <i>Argynnis montivaga</i>, Behr, n. sp. [Argynnis, No. 4. Proc. Cal.
Acad. II, 1862, p. 174.]</h5>

<p>If, as I strongly suspect, this species is still undescribed, I propose for it the
above name. It is not found near this bay, but seems to be widely spread
through the Sierra from whence I have specimens collected at different localities.
Those obtained by the Geological Survey are from an elevation of 10,500 feet.</p>

<h5>3. <i>Argynnis rupestris</i>, Behr, n. sp. [No. 6 of former article.]</h5>

<p>To the diagnosis formerly given I add the following character:</p>

<p>Margo anterior alarum anteriorum subtus quam disco pallidior.</p>

<p>The saturated coloration of the radical half of the hind wings, is not always
equal in its extent beyond the middle macular fascia, so that the diagnosis of No.
9 is in some respects near enough to cause confusion, if it were not that in No.
9 the anterior margin of the forewings is always decidedly darker than the disk,
furnishing a good diagnostic character. In general aspect they differ enough to
be recognized at the first glance, but it is very difficult to describe the other
differences.</p>

<p>The name I propose for No. 6, is derived from its inhabiting the steep rocky
declivities characterizing the lower part of the Sierra. The specimens were
collected by Prof. Brewer at a moderate elevation above the sea.</p>

<h5>4. <i>Argynnis monticola</i>, Behr, n. sp. [No. 8 of the former article.]</h5>

<p>This species was found in Yosemite Valley and some other localities, being
apparently not rare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h5>5. <i>Argynnis Antithore</i>, Boisd.</h5>

<p>One specimen only from Yosemite Valley.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Melitæa</span>, Fabr.</h4>

<p>It will be necessary to give a monograph of this genus before we go on with
the enumeration of the mountain species.</p>

<p>We have in California <i>eleven</i> well-marked species, a number far exceeding
those of the Atlantic Slope, and about equal to those of the whole of Europe. In
the “Synopsis of North American Lepidoptera,” written for the Smithsonian
Institution by John G. Morris, I find only two Californian species mentioned
and described, viz.: <i>M. Editha</i> and <i>M. Palla</i>, the “<i>M. Zerene</i>” of the same
work being without doubt an Argynnis. In a catalogue published by the same
author in 1860, I find besides those just mentioned another, viz; <i>M. Chalcedon</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Boisduval names several Melitæa in his letters to me, but gives no
diagnosis.</p>

<p>Our Californian Melitæa belong to four types.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type I.</span> The first is that of <i>M. Tharos</i>, represented by four distinct species
in California. This type is peculiar to the American Continent, occurring also
in the Atlantic States, and in the tropics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type II.</span> That of <i>M. Athalia</i>, represented by <i>M. Palla</i>, and several others.
It is also abundantly represented in Europe, but seems to be wanting in the
Atlantic States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type III.</span> That of <i>M. Phaeton</i>, corresponding exactly to the European, <i>M.
Maturna</i>, <i>M. Artemis</i>, etc., is represented in California by <i>M. Editha</i>, <i>M.
Chalcedon</i>, and others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type IV.</span> That of <i>M. Leanira</i> is numerous in the tropics of America but
seems to be wanting everywhere else except in California.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Melitæa</span>, Type I.</h5>

<h6>1. <i>M. montana</i>, Behr. Syn? <i>M. Pyrrha</i>, Doubleday.</h6>

<p>Alae supra aurantiacae, nigro clathratae, inter secundam et tertiam fasciam
nigram magis dilutae; posticae inter primam et secundam fasciam, serie
punctorum nigrorum signatae, fascia prima ab angulo anteriori interrupta, et
costam versus quintam tantum denuo cursum ad angulum posteriorem
recipiente.</p>

<p>Alae anticae subtus aurantiacae, disco fere concolori, nec maculis pallidiouibus
nec fasciis obscurioribus bene distinctis, apicem versus flavidae, maculls
fasciisque fuscis, et prope angulum posteriorem macula nigra signatae. Alae
posticae flavidae signaturis plus minus obscurioribus, in morem Argynnidum
undulatis, serie punctorum brunneorum inter primam et secundam fasciam ut
supra pertranseunte. Insuper inter costam quintam et sextam exstat lunula
submarginalis pallidior, interdum candida pruinaque argentea induta, quam
umbra amplectitur obscurior. Altera umbra a margine anteriori prope
apicem extenditur.</p>

<p>This species is very variable as to the markings of the underside of the hind
wings. Two specimens, which I received through the kindness of Mr. Lorquin,
have scarcely any markings there. These were collected in the neighborhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of Los Angeles. The others, received from the gentlemen of the survey, were
mostly collected at the headwaters of Tuolumne River, but some from Yosemite
Valley.</p>

<h6>2. <i>M. collina</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae omnes supra fulvae, nigro clathratae, posticae inter fasciam primam et
secundam serie punctorum nigrorum instructae.</p>

<p>Alae anticae subtus fulvae apicem versus gilvescentes, ubique signaturis fuscis,
marginemque versus aliquot maculis nigris obsitae.</p>

<p>Alae posticae subtus gilvae, hinc pruina argentea indutae, signaturis fuscis
in morem Argynnidum undulatis, binis semper per umbram quandam connexis,
hinc et illinc confluentibus, serie punctorum nigrorum halone amplexorum ut
supra inter fasciam primam et secundam pertranseunte. Lunula submarginalis
inter costam quintam et sextam major quam reliquae lunulae submarginales,
et umbra brunnea amplexa.</p>

<p>This species is not rare in the vicinity of San Francisco, and the hills of
Contra Costa, especially on the grassy valleys, along creeks, and on hillsides
with a varied vegetation of herbaceous plants. There must be many generations
of these annually, for the perfect insect is found from spring to autumn.</p>

<h6>3. <i>M. campestris</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae supra nigrae fasciis macularibus ochraceis et aurantiacis alternantibus.
Series punctorum nigrorum in alis posticis in fascia aurantiaca submarginali.</p>

<p>Alae anticae subtus aurantiacae apicem versus luteae. Macula disci et fascia
intermedia infracta luteae, haec intus nigro marginata. Alae posticae subtus
luteae, linea transversa undulata divisae; A radice usque ad lineam transversam
brunneo signatae et prope mediam lineam transversam umbra obscura indutae;
quae umbra extenditur usque ad seriem punctorum. Lunula inter quintam
costam et sextam candida, aucta et umbra amplexa.</p>

<p>This species is very common in different localities, especially on marshy places,
where Hemizonia abounds. Seems to be peculiar to the lower regions, and
produces several annual generations.</p>

<h6>4. <i>M. pratensis</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae supra nigrae fasciis macularibus fulvis instructae. Maculae fasciae
submarginalis alarum posticarum singulae singula puncta nigra gerentes.</p>

<p>Alae anticae subtus ochraceae maculis pallidioribus hinc et illinc signatae.
Marginem versus posticam extant aliquot maculae nigrae. Alae posticae subtus
hepaticae lineis undulatis, maculis, umbris serieque punctorum cunctis aeque
brunneis instructae. Lunula submarginalis vix pallidior et umbra amplectente
tantum e reliqua ala discerni potest.</p>

<p>This species is found on grassy hillsides and is common enough in some
localities near San Francisco. Several generations are found from spring to
the beginning of the rainy season.</p>

<p>Before I had a sufficient series of these nearly allied species in my possession,
I considered them local varieties of one single species. Afterwards I had an
idea that two of them, <i>M. collina</i> and <i>pratensis</i> might be seasonal varieties or
alternating generations, like for instance <i>Arachnia Prorsa</i>, whose vernal generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<i>A. Levana</i> was for a long time considered another species. But according
to my observations continued through several years, these species are not confined
to certain seasons, but are to be found throughout the dry season. If they
were alternating generations of the same insect the different forms would
be found only at certain seasons; but such is not the case.</p>

<p><i>M. montana</i> is very variable but never approaches to the characters of the
other three species. The rest are as constant as a species can be, and in a
long series of duplicates from different localities I do not find anything like an
intermediate form.</p>

<p>The four species of this type agree in the following points:</p>

<p>1. A row of dots between the first and second transverse lines of the hindwings,
in the space that represents in these species the submarginal fascia.
This row is clearly visible on both sides.</p>

<p>2. The marginal lunula between the fifth and sixth vein is perceptibly augmented
on both sides, and on the other side is frequently of lighter color and
always surrounded by a deeper shade.</p>

<p>The most positive characters distinguishing the species is found on the disc
of the underside of forewings.</p>

<p>1. <i>M. montana</i>, has the disc uniform fulvous the markings of the upper-side
shining through the coloration of the disc.</p>

<p>2. <i>M. collina</i>, has the disc orange color; markings very perceptible and
towards the exterior margin bordered by a series of black spots.</p>

<p>3. <i>M. campestris</i>, has the disc with a yellow spot between the first and second
primary costa, and is bordered towards the exterior margin by an angular row
of yellow spots, which are themselves bordered at the inner side by deep black.</p>

<p>4. <i>M. pratensis</i>, has the disc ochre yellow with irregularly diluted spots and
some black marks near the <i>posterior</i> margin.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other points of difference, as may be seen by comparing
the diagnoses. But for recognition of any of the species it is sufficient to
examine the disc. The other differences are difficult to describe, as all those
who know by their own experience the difficulties of analyzing the complicated
markings of the underside of the hindwings in this group will testify. As to
the larval state of these insects nothing is known, and this want of facts regarding
their metamorphosis, is the more to be lamented as the natural affinities of
this type are by no means very clear or simple. It seems to constitute a kind
of intermediate group between the true <i>Melitæae</i> and the Arctic type of
<i>Argynnides</i>. The eyes are more prominent than in the typical species of
Melitæa, and I find a similar conformation of the head in <i>M. Tharos</i> from the
Atlantic States. At the same time the underside of the hindwings of all these
species does not represent the well-defined alternate bands of the typical
<i>Melitæae</i>, but the intricate undulations and undefined lights and shadows of
the underside of the Arctic type of <i>Argynnis</i>. In fact <i>M. montana</i> approaches
in this respect very closely to <i>A. Aphirape</i>.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Type II.</span></h5>

<p>This type corresponds to the European type of <i>M. Athalia</i>, and
even in the differential characters of the four species known to me there is a
striking parallelism to those of four European species, so that each of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
looks as if it was the transposition of a foreign species separated by a peculiarly
Californian character, afterwards to be pointed out, from its European congener,
and separated amongst themselves by the very same characters that
separate the four European parallel species from each other. Their analogies
are as follows:</p>

<table summary="Parallel species in different locations">
  <tr>
    <th><i>California.</i></th>
    <th><i>Europe.</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Palla</span>,</td>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Dictynna</span>,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Whitneyi</span>,</td>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Athalia</span>,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Gabbii</span>,</td>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Parthenie</span>,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Hoffmanni</span>,</td>
     <td><span class="smcap">M. Asteria</span>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The Californians differ from their European analogues in the orange color that
fills the space between the margin and the marginal line on the underside. In
the European species this space always has the same pale tint that forms the
ground color.</p>

<p>Then the two waving lines that inclose the submarginal band on the underside
of the hind wings, are not entirely filled by the orange or fulvous spots as
in the European, but have an empty space between the first and second, and
the second and third veins.</p>

<h6>1. <i>Melitæa Palla</i>, Boisd.</h6>

<p>Alae maris supra fulvae nigro clathratae, feminae nigrae nonnullis fasciis
macularibus gilvis instructae.</p>

<p>Alae posticae subtus gilvae lineis nigris et maculis aurantiacis ordinariis
instructae, necnon serie lunularum fasciae submarginalis fulvarum a vena tertia
inchoantium usque ad ultimam decurrentium. <i>Quaeque lunula continet
ocellum.</i></p>

<p>I repeat the diagnosis for the purpose of adding a character that has been
hitherto overlooked but is essential for separating this species from the following.
It is the eye-spot contained in each of the orange-colored spots of the
submarginal band. It is true that these spots are not in every specimen equally
visible, and often require the help of the glass to make them visible, but still
they are never wanting as in the following species.</p>

<p><i>M. Palla</i> is the only one of this type found in the vicinity of San Francisco,
where it is rather common. Nevertheless I have not yet succeeded in finding
the caterpillar, but have heard from our celebrated entomologist, Mr. Lorquin,
that he has raised this butterfly from a caterpillar found on a species of
<i>Plantago</i>.</p>

<h6>2. <i>Melitæa Whitneyi</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae maris supra rubricantes nigro clathratae feminae, fere eædem, colore
tantum dilutiori hinc et illinc paululum alternantes.</p>

<p>Alae posticae subtus iis <i>M. Pallae</i> similes sed <i>lunulae fasciae submarginalis
ocellis omnino destitutae</i>.</p>

<p>At the first look the difference between this species and <i>M. Palla</i> is striking
enough, for the coloration of the upperside is quite different and the reticulate
black marking runs in much thinner lines and is more regular than in <i>M. Palla</i>,
where towards the margin the black markings unite more or less and cover the
ground color. The striking alteration in the colors of the upper side in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the series of <i>M. Palla</i> does not exist here and the female is sometimes quite like
the male. Sometimes the ground color alternates transversely with a slightly
diluted tint, and for the female this character would be sufficient. But both
sexes differ in the constant absence of the eye-spots of the submarginal band.</p>

<p>I received this species from the headwaters of the Tuolumne River where it
was collected during the stay of the State Geological Survey in the elevated and
uninhabited regions. I take this opportunity of showing my respect for Prof.
Whitney and the other members of that learned party, to all of whom I am
under obligations for the kindness with which, under all kinds of hardships,
they collected materials for a Fauna of our Californian Lepidoptera.</p>

<h6>3. <i>M. Gabbii</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae maris supra ut in <i>M. Palla</i>, feminae fasciis transversis alternantibus luteis
et fulvis totae nigro clathratae.</p>

<p>Alae inferiores ut in <i>M. Palla</i>, sed maculae radicales candidae pruinaque
argentea renitentes ita ut fascia intermedia lunulaeque marginales. Fasciae,
maculae, et margo aurantiacae ordinariae. Fasciae submarginalis spatium, quae
non occupatur lunulis aurantiacis, sulphureum.</p>

<p>I received this species from the mountains near Los Angeles and have seen a
series of specimens constantly showing the same characters. This description
I made from a pair kindly communicated to me by Mr. Lorquin.</p>

<h6>4. <i>M. Hoffmanni</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae et maris et feminae a radice usque ad medium nigrae hinc et illinc
maculis luteis fulvisque obsitae, a media ala luteae marginem versus fulvescentes
plus minus nigro clathratae.</p>

<p>Alae inferiores subtus ut in <i>M. Palla</i>, sed fascia submarginalis inter lineas
undulatas nigras, non lunulis sed punctis omnino rotundis constituta.</p>

<p>This species is less rare than the two preceding. Nevertheless it has not
yet been found near San Francisco and seems peculiar to the higher regions of
California.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Melitæa</span>, Type III.</h5>

<p>Of this type, we know already as many Californian as European species,
but except <i>M. Phaeton</i>, I do not know any Eastern representative of this
type. The most robust and gaily colored species belong to this type and
it is one of the most predominant of the diurnal types in California, not only
from the number of its species but also of its individuals.</p>

<h6>1. <i>Melitæa Chalcedon</i>, Doubleday.</h6>

<p>This showy species is very common around the Bay of San Francisco. The
caterpillar is somewhat of the coloration of that of <i>Vanessa Antiopa</i>, but short
and thick like all the <i>Melitæa</i> caterpillars and beset with short fleshy thorns.
The dorsal row of spines is brick red and so is the lateral stripe above the feet.
All other parts, both of the body and spines, are black, which tint, being
thickly sprinkled with white dots has a bluish luster like the same tint in the
caterpillar of <i>V. Antiopa</i>.</p>

<p>Most commonly this caterpillar is found on <i>Scrophularia</i>, but I have found
it also on <i>Diplacus glutinosus</i> and on a <i>Lonicera</i>, related to <i>L. Caprifolium</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
The chrysalis is white with black and yellow dots. The butterfly is developed
towards the end of April and is found until the end of June. There exists only
one generation. The caterpillars grow very slowly through the summer. They
are social and weave a kind of nest, in which they also hibernate. In spring
their growth is quick enough, but they seem to be subject to much disease, and
even in their natural state are frequently found half dried up. The butterfly
also is often caught with crippled wings.</p>

<h6>2. <i>M. Cooperi</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p>Alae supra ut <i>M. Chalcedontis</i>, subtus inferiores sulphureae fasciis et maculis
ordinariis fuscis, maculis fasciae submarginalis <i>fuscis concoloribus, neque ullo
halone cicumdatae</i>.</p>

<p>This species is very similar to <i>M. Chalcedon</i>, but the want of the yellowish
halo around the lunulae of the brown band on the underside, is a very positive
diagnostic character. The brown color of the bands also is always of the same
somber hue as that of the underside of the forewings, and never of the fiery
brick red that colors this fascia on the underside of <i>M. Chalcedon</i>, forming a
perceptible contrast to the somber coloring of the underside of the forewings,
which is the same in <i>M. Chalcedon</i> and <i>M. Cooperi</i>. With all these well-marked
differences, the two species look so much alike, that it would have been
a long time before <i>M. Cooperi</i> would have been recognized as a distinct species,
if it had not been for the striking difference of its caterpillar, which was discovered
by Mr. Lorquin near Clear Lake on a species of <i>Scrophularia</i>. This
caterpillar is much more elongated than that of <i>Chalcedon</i>. It is nearly of the
shape and coloration of that of the European <i>M. Artemis</i>, brimstone yellow,
with a dorsal and a lateral black stripe. We were quite justified in expecting
from such a caterpillar something strikingly different from the very common
type of <i>Chalcedon</i>. But to our surprise our chrysalids gave us a series of
crippled butterflies, which could scarcely be distinguished from <i>M. Chalcedon</i>.
Since that time I have received a well-developed specimen through the kindness
of Baron Koels, who caught it with several other insects on an excursion to
Mount Tamal Pais.</p>

<p>It is pretty certain that <i>M. Cooperi</i> will be found in many other localities,
as it is only its similarity to our most common vernal butterfly, the <i>M. Chalcedon</i>,
that makes it escape our attention.</p>

<h6>3. <i>M. Quino</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p><i>M. Chalcedonti</i> similis sed antennae clava discolor, fusca nec concolor
antennae reliquae aurantiacae.</p>

<p>Alae supra ut in <i>M. Chalcedonte</i> sed series macularum submarginalium in
anticis rubra et marginalium in posticis flava rubro tincta. Series quarta in
anticis bifida, fere tota rubra, tertia in posticis omnino rubra.</p>

<p>Alae inferiores subtus ut in <i>M. Chalcedonte</i> sed fascia flava prope radicem in
maculas sex dissecta maculaque flava discalis puncto ejusdem coloris extus
aucta.</p>

<p><i>Melitæa Quino</i> may at once be distinguished by the entirely different and
much gayer coloration of the upper side, which much more resembles that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<i>M. Anicia</i> than <i>M. Chalcedon</i>. To the latter species it comes the nearest in
the peculiar shape of the wings, so characteristically different in the two sexes.
In <i>M. Anicia</i> this difference exists but not to the same degree. The yellow
part of the underside of the hindwings is much paler than in <i>M. Chalcedon</i> and
<i>M. Anicia</i>. The yellow radical band is dissolved into six distinct but nearly
connected maculae. In <i>M. Chalcedon</i> the band is not interrupted and only the
sixth macula is separated, making part of the yellow coloration of the anal side
of the wing. From <i>M. Anicia</i> it differs besides, in the underside of the forewings
being nearly all of a reddish-brown color with scarcely any indication of
the markings of the upperside, closely resembling <i>M. Chalcedon</i>. From both
species <i>M. Quino</i> differs in the coloration of the club of the antenna.</p>

<p>This species I received from Dr. Cooper, formerly of the State Geological
Survey, who collected several specimens near San Diego. I have called it
Quino in remembrance of the California Pioneer, Padre Quino, the first
European that ever succeeded in erecting a permanent settlement in California,
and at the same time contributed very considerably by his learned writings
to a more exact knowledge of these then scarcely discovered regions.</p>

<h6>4. <i>M. Anicia</i>, Doubleday.</h6>

<p>This species seems to be restricted to the eastern and more elevated part of
the State. Most of my specimens are from Mariposa.</p>

<h6>5. <i>M. nubigena</i>, Behr, n. sp.</h6>

<p><i>M. Aniciae</i> similis sed antennarum clava nigrescens, et subtus in alis posticis
fasciae pallidae intermediae bipartitae pars exterior aurantiaca, ut fascia lunularum
quae sequitur eam.</p>

<p>This species was caught in considerable numbers by Mr. Hoffman at the
headwaters of the Tuolumne River and beyond, up to elevations of 11,500
feet. It evidently stands in the same relation to <i>M. Anicia</i> as in Europe <i>M.
Merope</i> does to <i>M. Artemis</i>. I am not certain if <i>M. nubigena</i> is to be considered
an alpine variety of <i>M. Anicia</i> or an independent species, nor as far as
I know is the question yet decided as to the right to distinction of <i>M. Merope</i>,
a long-known alpine insect of Europe. Nevertheless, considering the
different coloration of the antenna club, I am very much inclined to think
<i>M. nubigena</i> more than a mere alpine variety.</p>

<h6>6. <i>M. Editha</i>, Boisd.</h6>

<p>This species is found in different localities near San Francisco and Contra
Costa. Nevertheless, it is much rarer than <i>M. Chalcedon</i> and of a more restless
disposition. It makes its appearance before <i>M. Chalcedon</i> and is one of our
first vernal butterflies. About the caterpillar I have not yet succeeded in
ascertaining anything.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Melitæa</span>, Type IV.</h5>

<p>Of this type only one Californian species is yet known, but there may be
perhaps some other species in the southern parts of the State, as the subtropical
territory of New Mexico seems rather to abound in this type.</p>

<h6>1. <i>M. Leanira</i>, Boisd. (In litteris.)</h6>

<p>Antennae totae fulvae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Alae supra nigrae, fasciis macularibus duabus et radicem versus maculis
tribus quadrangularibus omnibus gilvescentibus instructae. Alae anticae prope
marginem anticam, apicem versus et ad marginem externam mediam, e nigro
rubescentes.</p>

<p>Alae anticae subtus rubrae iisdem maculis ut supra ornatae. Fascia macularis
externa extus nigro marginata. Alae posticae subtus gilvescentes nigro
venosae, et nigro marginatae, radicem versus nigro signatae; supra medium
fascia nigra instructae, catenam moniliformem continente punctorum gilvorum.</p>

<p>Limbus ubique et supra et subtus nigro alboque variegatus.</p>

<p><i>M. Leanira</i> is so distinct from all other <i>Melitæae</i>, that it is impossible to make
any error in reference to its diagnosis. It is found in June and July in valleys
of the Contra Costa hills, where I collected it myself. I received other specimens
from Yosemite Valley. I have not succeeded in finding the caterpillar.</p>

<p>I have to add a few observations regarding the geographical distribution of
the genus <i>Melitæa</i> in general and of its different types separately.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Melitæa</i> spreads from the Arctic zone to the tropic of Cancer and
some mountain species even farther. Unlike the genus <i>Argynnis</i> in its geographical
distribution <i>Melitæa</i> has no Antarctic species. It has its center of
abundance in the temperate zone and decreases towards the tropics as well as
the arctic zone. According to that peculiarity of the western slope of continents
by which the temperate zone is more developed in extent and quality, than
in the eastern slopes, the greatest number of species are found in Europe and on
our coast. Eastern Asia has very few species, but the genus is better represented
on the Atlantic side of this continent, where however, it appears in the
aberrant forms of <i>M. Tharos</i>, <i>M. Pyrrha</i>, etc, whose real nature seems still
doubtful and which are at least intermediate between <i>Argynnis</i> and <i>Melitæa</i>.</p>

<p>The genuine type is very uniform, and therefore the diagnosis of the Californian
as well as the European species is enveloped in many difficulties, so that
even in regard to many European species known and described for more than a
century, the limits of the species are frequently more or less doubtful and
nearly every Catalogue gives the series of closely allied species in a different
form.</p>

<p>California possesses two types wanting to the European Fauna; Europe
one type wanting to California. To us the type of <i>M. Cinxia</i> is wanting, to Europe
that most characteristic form of <i>M. Leanira</i>, which is a very natural transition
to the genus <i>Synchloe</i>. The other wanting to the old world is that of <i>M.
Pyrrha</i>, an osculant form peculiar to the new world where it extends nearly as
far as the equator.</p>

<p>As regards the development of the genus in size and brilliancy of color, the
Californians have a decided advantage. The giants of the genus are all Californian
and the coloration more bright and more distinct than the somber hues
of their less-developed European allies.</p>

<p>Like the Argynnides the Melitæae are essentially local. There is no Amphigeic
species, and even the Polar species (which in Argynnis are sometimes
Amphigeic) are always different in this genus, never occurring both in Europe
and America. In the same way the Atlantic and Pacific species seem always
to differ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>These butterflies not having a very powerful flight are generally confined to
circumscribed localities, in which they are generally plentiful and easily collected.
Their caterpillars are frequently social like those of the <i>Vanessæ</i>, preferring the
family of Scrophalarineous plants, (<i>Scrophularia</i> in California, <i>Linaria</i> and
<i>Veronica</i> in Europe), but inclined more to polyphagy than the Argynnides, in
their predilection for the Violarineae. Besides the Scrophalarineae the <i>Melitæae</i>
live on <i>Plantago</i>, <i>Lonicera</i>, <i>Scabiosa</i>, and some even are found on shrubby trees
of <i>Salix</i>, <i>Populus</i>, and <i>Fagus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—Height of body one eighth of its length from tip of
nose to fork of tail, length of head almost one fifth of the same (0·19). Width
of forehead in front of eyes more than five eighths the length of head (0·69);
diameter of eye less than one third of same length (0·30). Scale between
eyes equilateral, and a little less than half of the width of head. No granulated
area in front of orbit, and but a very narrow one behind it. Preoperculum
rounded rectangular. Pectoral fin extending to halfway between end of dorsal
and base of caudal, 0·60 of total length. Ventrals inserted nearer operculum
than base of caudal, and extending to middle of anal. Dorsal commencing
over 36th scale and extending to 48th.</p>

<p class="center">D. 12, P. 14, V. 6, A. 10, C. 3-1-4-5-1-6. Scales 58-7/1.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—Steel-blue, fins smoky, below silvery, iris gilt.</p>

<p><i>General form</i> much elongated, subcylindrical. Top of head perfectly flat,
its width equal to its depth. Anterior half of body nearly as broad as high,
compressed above. Posterior half compressed laterally, tapering to tail, the
caudal peduncle three times as high as it is broad. A slight ridge along insertion
of dorsal. Lateral line prominent, running close to insertion of ventrals.
Proportions of fins to total length, as follows:</p>

<p>Length of specimen fifteen inches, the figure representing it half the natural

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—In the preceding diagnosis I have followed the arrangement of
specific characters adopted by Gill in his description of two new species of
<i>Exocœtus</i> from the Pacific Coast of Central America. (Proc. Acad. Phil.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
June, 1863, p. 167.) By comparison it will be seen that our species is very
distinct.</p>

<p>This large species of Flying-Fish is found in great numbers during the summer
south of Point Conception, and some wander as far north as Santa Cruz at
least. They can only be taken when they happen to alight on board of a vessel
or in gill-nets, which I was not provided with during my late voyage among the
islands. Their flight is rarely higher than ten feet above the water, but sometimes
extends nearly a quarter of a mile.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Urolophus Halleri</span>, Cooper, State collection, species 522. [<a href="#fig21"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></a>]</h5>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—Disk suborbicular, obtusely pointed in front, and with
the pectoral fins rounded behind. Length anterior to anus a little greater than
that of the tail behind it. Posterior outline of ventral fins projecting a little
behind that of disk. Claspers as long as ventrals and projecting entirely behind
them. Tail 0·47 of total length, gradually tapering from a cylindrical base to
the spine, thence becoming flattened laterally expanding into a fin, which commences
opposite the base of spine below, and ends opposite to its end above,
broadest near its end, where its width is 0·10 the length of tail. Spiracles a
little larger than orbits and farther apart, the distance between them equal to
that from snout to orbits. Ventrals forming nearly equilateral triangles, their
basal length one fifth that of head and body. Caudal spine arising at 0·48 of
the length of tail, and not quite one third as long. Female more elongated
than male but tail and spine shorter; the ventrals a fourth longer and more
acute.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—Reddish speckled with yellow, below white. In some specimens the
dark and light colors above are about equally distributed, the spots having a
somewhat marbled arrangement. In others the light spots are very few and
widely separated. Popular name “Round Stingray.” The figure is half the
natural size. The dots show the principal outlines of the cartilaginous skeleton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—While this fish has the nearly orbicular outline of <i>Urotrygon</i>
(<i>mundus</i>), Gill, from Panama (Proc. Phil. Acad., June, 1863, p. 173), it
differs generically in having obtusely triangular teeth (equilateral), tail shorter
than body, spine nearest to its base, smooth skin, etc.</p>

<p>It differs from <i>Urolophus</i>, as described by Richardson, in the upper velum of
mouth being entire, and in having about twenty small tubercles on the surface
of lower velum. These however can scarcely be considered generic differences.</p>

<p>Found abundantly in muddy creeks at San Pedro and San Diego, those from
the former place being more uniform in color.</p>

<p>While I was at San Diego the little son of Major G. O. Haller, U. S. A.
was wounded in the foot, probably by one of these fish, while wading along a
muddy shore of the bay. The wound was very painful for some hours, though
small. Another large rhomboidal species also abundant there but apparently
still undescribed, inflicts very severe and dangerous wounds, of which I may
have more to say hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>This fish has great muscular power and can dart very rapidly through the
water by lateral vibrations of its tail, at the same time quickly flapping the edge
of its disk, to keep its level in the water and to regulate its direction.</p>

<p>It frequently buries itself slightly under the mud, and if disturbed obscures
the water by stirring the mud, vanishing in the cloud thus raised to hide itself
again. It will allow a boat to pass over its place of concealment, and may, if
detected, be easily killed by a blow with the end of an oar. Many are also
caught in the seines of the fishermen.</p>

<p>Their food consists of small mollusca, crustacea and such other animals, alive
or dead, as they can obtain.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Annual Meeting, January 4th, 1864.</span></h2>

<p class="center">President in the Chair.</p>

<p>Fifteen members present.</p>

<p>E. Mathewson, Esq., of Martinez, was elected resident member.</p>

<p>The following is an abstract of the Annual Reports of the officers
of the Society, for the past year (1863):</p>

<p>The Financial Report of the Trustees was received and accepted.
During the year, $815.35 have been received from various sources,
besides the balance on hand from 1862, of $141.22; $903.75
expended; and $52.82 remains in the hands of the Treasurer.</p>

<p>The Librarian (Prof. Whitney) reported verbally, that about
fifty volumes have been added to the Library, mostly the publications
of other Societies; that some sets of Journals have been
rendered complete, by his own donations, and that the volumes of
the “American Journal of Science” have been bound.</p>

<p>The Curator of Mineralogy (Mr. Moore) reports, that the collection
is in nearly the same condition that it was at the commencement
of the last year, that but few additions have been made, and
that the work of cataloguing and classifying the specimens is in
progress.</p>

<p>The Curator of Palæontology (Mr. Gabb) made no report.</p>

<p>The Curator of Botany (Dr. Kellogg) reports, that some additions
have been made; that the collections are not in good condition
for want of suitable cases, and recommends that new cases be
procured, and that a suite of the specimens described by members
of the Society be sent East, for comparison with specimens in those
herbariums to which we have no access.</p>

<p>The Curator of Zoology (Dr. Cooper) made a verbal report,
that he has been absent the most of the year, and that the collection
has not materially changed since the last report, with the
exception of an interesting collection of Birds deposited by Mr.
Holder.</p>

<p>The Curator of Conchology (Dr. Trask) reported verbally, that
about three hundred species of shells have been added to the collection
during the year. Also, that he had received from Mr.
Andrew Garrett, a collection of one hundred and fifteen species of
Hawaiian Fishes, for the Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The Curator of Entomology (Dr. Behr) reported verbally, that
there have been no contributions, but that he will contribute from
his own collection, and other persons have expressed their desire
to do likewise, when the Society shall possess the means of accommodating
and preserving the specimens.</p>

<p>The officers of the preceding year were reëlected, with the
exception of Treasurer—S. Hubbard being elected in the place of
Wm. Heffley, resigned.</p>

<p>The following resolution, prepared by Dr. Ayres, was unanimously
adopted:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That hereafter the Proceedings of the Academy be
distributed gratuitously only to resident members and to such
Societies and individuals as the Academy shall direct; and that
the price of subscription to others be regulated by the Publishing
Committee.</p>

</div>

<p>The Society authorized the publication of the following Constitutional
amendments, adopted at the annual meeting, January 6th,
1862, the publication of which was accidentally omitted in the
Proceedings of that year:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Amendment to Art. II, Sec. 4—That the Membership Fee, to
be paid by an applicant for Resident membership, shall be two
dollars, etc.—the remainder of the section remaining as before.</p>

<p>Amendment to Art. III, Sec. 2—This Association shall hold
meetings on the First and Third Monday evenings of each month,
for the investigation of Natural History, etc.—the remainder of
the section remaining as before.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Ayres read extracts from letters containing inquiries in
regard to the first volume of the Proceedings of the Society, which
terminated abruptly, and was never finished. The supply has
long been exhausted, and the republication has been frequently
discussed; but as yet this is beyond the means of the Society.</p>

<p>Prof. Brewer communicated the following paper by Prof. Gray,
giving the first installment of a series of descriptions of new plants
from the botanical collections made by himself, while engaged in the
State Geological Survey. These are a portion of the new species
collected previous to 1863. The remainder will be described in
future papers, along with those from the collection made after that
time.</p>

<h3>Descriptions of New Californian Plants—No. I.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PROF. ASA GRAY.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Streptanthus</span> Nutt.</h4>

<h5><i>S. Breweri</i>, n. sp. [§ Euclisia.]</h5>

<p>Wholly glabrous and glaucous, annual, branched from near the base; cauline
leaves (except the lowest) strongly cordate-clasping, with a closed sinus, entire
or denticulate, the uppermost sagittate; flowers purple, on very short ascending
pedicels, the lowest often leafy-bracted; the buds often a quarter of an inch
long, obtuse, or barely acute; the sepals with scarious but blunt recurved tips;
siliques narrowly linear, ascending or erect, straight or slightly incurved (1½-2½
inches long, less than a line wide,) compressed but torulose, the nerve of
the valves obscure; seeds wholly marginless.</p>

<p>This most resembles <i>S. tortuosus Kellogg</i> (which is S. <i>cordatus Torr.</i>, in <i>Bot.
Pacif. R. R. Whipple’s Rep.</i> but evidently not of <i>Nuttall</i>), from which the above
character indicates the differences.</p>

<p>There are three forms in the collection: 1. A dwarf state, in flower only,
from Mt. Shasta, at an altitude of 8,000 feet. 2. A very glaucous form, with
more numerous and rather smaller flowers, and with fruit, from the top of a dry
mountain of the Mt. Diablo Range, near head of Arroyo del Puerto, at an altitude
of 3,200 feet. 3. Another, in flower and fruit, with more naked and virgate
branches, a foot or two in height, from San Carlos Mountain, near New Idria,
5,000 feet altitude. This is remarkable for having the calyx hoary-downy, but the
plant is otherwise glabrous and glaucous.</p>

<h5><i>S. hispidus</i>, n. sp. (§ Euclisia.)</h5>

<p>Very dwarf, (2-3 inches high, from an annual root,) hispid throughout, even
to the siliques; leaves cuneate or obovate-oblong, coarsely toothed or incised,
the cauline-sessile but hardly at all clasping; raceme short and loosely flowered;
pedicels spreading or at length recurved in flower (which is red or red-violet)
but the linear compressed siliques (1½ inch long, a line wide,) are erect; stigma
almost sessile; immature seeds winged.</p>

<p>Mt. Diablo, dry places near summit.</p>

<p>This ranks next to <i>S. heterophyllus</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Viola</span> L.</h4>

<h5><i>V. ocellata</i>, Torr. and Gray, <i>var.</i></h5>

<p>Glabrous, smaller; leaves somewhat thickish; peduncles elongated. Very
curious and distinct. From Tamalpais.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Arenaria</span> L.</h4>

<h5><i>A. brevifolia</i> Nutt.? <i>var. Californica</i>.</h5>

<p>Much branched or diffuse, cymosely many-flowered; petals and sepals somewhat
narrower.</p>

<p>Leaves as in Nuttall’s plant, thickish, plane, mostly obtuse and spreading.
Valves of the capsule entire. Filaments opposite and twice the length of the
sepals, more dilated and glandular at the base. Seeds minute, minutely muricate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
turgid. The fruit and seed are known only from Frémont’s specimens
communicated to Dr. Torrey (No. 284 of Coll. 1846,) from California, a taller
and less diffuse form than that now collected by Prof. Brewer, and more like
Nuttall’s, from Tatnall County, Georgia. But my original specimen of the latter
little-known plant is too incomplete to make certain the identity; and the two
are widely sundered in geographical station. Still no adequate characters yet
appear to distinguish specifically. Prof. Brewer collected his plant April 18th,
in the valleys among high ridges in Sonoma, where it abounded.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Calandrinia</span> H. B. &amp; K.</h4>

<h5><i>C. Menziesii</i>, Hook.</h5>

<p>In various forms in southern California. Capsule slightly if at all exceeding
the calyx; seeds rather turgid, shining; petals mostly much exceeding the calyx.</p>

<h5><i>C. Menziesii, var. macrocarpa.</i></h5>

<p>Stems and racemes at length more elongated and loosely-leaved; pedicels in
fruit much spreading or recurved; capsule ovoid-fusiform, projecting beyond
the calyx; seeds smaller, compressed and opaque.</p>

<p>Dry hills of the Santa Inez mountains, near Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Perhaps a distinct species, but I want to see it confirmed by other specimens.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Linum</span> L.</h4>

<h5><i>L. Breweri</i>, n. sp.</h5>

<p>Annual; glabrous; stem very small, not striate, with few flowers crowded at
the apex; leaves filiform, smooth, alternate and opposite; stipules conspicuously
glandular; pedicels shorter than the calyx; sepals oblong-ovate, acute, one-nerved,
margin not scarious, glandular, less than half as long as the bright
yellow, obovate-oblong petals; anthers elongated-oblong; sterile filaments almost
wanting; styles three, distinct; stigma somewhat acutely pointed.</p>

<p>Dry hill sides of the Diablo Range, near Marsh’s Ranch, May 29th.</p>

<p>Plant barely two to three inches high, “but seen in the valley larger, with
many flowers, not yet expanded.”</p>

<p>This, like <i>L. Californicum</i>, appears to be uniformly tri-carpellary; flowers
about the size of those of that species, and the anthers elongated-oblong; but
the leaves narrower; the stigmas not at all capitate or enlarged, but minute
and acute; fruit not seen.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Trifolium</span>, L.</h4>

<h5><i>T. bifidum</i>, n. sp.</h5>

<p>Somewhat villose or glabrous; stems from small (annual?) root, slender,
spreading; stipules ovate-lanceolate, setaceously-acuminate, entire; leaflets
linear-cuneate, lateral ones rarely dentate, bifid or incised at the apex with a
mucronate point between the lobes; peduncles twice or three times as long as
the leaves; heads naked, six to twelve flowered, or more; flowers pedicelled, at
length reflexed; calyx five-parted, dentate, subulate-setaceous, somewhat hirsute,
and nearly equal to the persistent, rose-colored scarious corolla.</p>

<p>Near Marsh’s Ranch, between Monte Diablo and the San Joaquin, among
grass in a ravine near the water, May 29th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Stems six to sixteen inches long. Heads and flowers about the size of those
of the small form of <i>T. gracilentum</i>, to which species it is allied. Ovary two-ovulate,
seeds single.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Astragalus</span> L.</h4>

<h5><i>A. curtipes</i>, n. sp. (§ Phaca, *Inflati.)</h5>

<p>Minutely canescent, at length glabrate, a foot high; stipules connate, opposite
the leaf; leaflets twelve to sixteen pairs narrowly oblong, retuse petiolulate,
glabrous above; raceme in fruit short; calyx-teeth slender, subulate, slightly
shorter than the campanulate tube; legume membranaceous, inflated, glabrate
(1½ inches long,) semi-ovoid, (the ventral suture nearly straight, the dorsal
very gibbous,) scarcely acute at either end, jointed to a rigid stipe, which does
not exceed the tube of the calyx.</p>

<p>Dry hill sides, San Luis Obispo. Corolla not seen.</p>

<h5><i>A. oxyphysus</i>, n. sp. (§ Phaca, *Inflati.)</h5>

<p>Tall, very softly canescen-villous; stipules small, scarious, distinct; leaflets
8-11 pairs, oblong; peduncles much surpassing the leaf; raceme elongated;
bracts small and subulate; teeth of the silky calyx subulate, half the length of
the cylindraceous tube; corolla white or greenish; legume obovate-acuminate,
the base attenuate into a recurved stipe which somewhat exceeds the calyx.</p>

<p>Monte Diablo Range, near Arroyo Puerto, on dry hills.</p>

<p>A most distinct and striking new species.</p>

<h5><i>A. Breweri</i>, n. sp.</h5>

<p>Allied to <i>A. tener</i> Gray, Rev. Astrag. (<i>Phaca astragalina, var.</i>? Hook. and
Arn., and probably <i>A. hypoglottis, var. strigosa</i>, Kellogg,) but more branched
from the annual root, and with broader leaflets, (4-5 pairs, oblong-obcordate);
head 5-7 flowered, compact; immature legume globose-ovate, silky-canescent,
not stipulate, erect, six-ovulate, one-celled, the dorsal suture slightly intruded.</p>

<p>Fields in Sonoma Valley, April. Common.</p>

<p>Dr. Ayres read letters from Mr. A. Garrett, and presented the

<h3>Descriptions of New Species of Fishes—No. II.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ANDREW GARRETT, OF HONOLULU, SANDWICH ISLANDS.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Cheilodactylus</span> Lacep. 1803.</h4>

<h5><i>C. vittatus</i> Garrett.</h5>

<p class="center">B. 6; D. 17-30; A. 3-8; V. 1-5; P. 8-6; C. 5, 1, 7, 6, 1, 4.</p>

<p>The height of the body is a trifle less than one-third of the total length. The
upper profile rises in a convex line from the snout to the occipital region, whence
it suddenly ascends in a nearly vertical curve, giving that portion of the fish a
strongly gibbous appearance. The body rapidly tapers posteriorly, though preserving
a slightly convex outline. The head enters nearly four and a half times
in the entire length. The eyes are large, sub-circular in shape, even with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
line of profile, and their greatest diameter is nearly one-third the length of the
head. They are placed nearer the origin of the lateral line than the end of the
snout. The small maxillary bone extends as far back as the anterior margin of
the eye.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin takes its origin immediately above the posterior limb of the
orbit and terminates within one diameter of the eye of the caudal fin. Its three
anterior rays are very small, and the fourth, which is the tallest, is one-third as
long as the base of the whole fin, or equal to two-thirds the height of the body.
Posteriorly the spiny rays rapidly diminish in altitude so that the last one is
shorter than the succeeding soft rays. The soft portion of the fin is comparatively
low, gently convex along its upper edge, and is equally as long as the
spiny part. The anal fin is small, being inserted just in advance of the middle
of the soft portion of the dorsal. Its extreme margin is slightly concave and the
rays rapidly diminish in length posteriorly. The ventrals when laid back reach
as far as the anal fin. The second simple pectoral ray extends as far back as
the vent. The caudal, which is deeply forked, has its lobes rounded off.</p>

<p>Color greyish-silvery, and ornamented with five oblique blackish-brown bands
which are disposed as follows: one extends from the snout to the preopercular
margin, the second starts from the eye and terminates on the pectoral base, the
third, which passes over the occipital region, extends below the pectoral axilla;
the fourth, which is much broader, starts from the origin of the dorsal fin, curves
downward and backward, becoming wider in its descent, and passes beneath the
abdomen; the fifth one commences on the upper anterior half of the spiny
dorsal, extending along the back to near the termination of that fin. Three
irregular, pale spots may be observed in the dorsal band, and three large blackish-brown
spots on the caudal trunk. The opercular flap and snout tinged with
orange-red. The interorbital space is marked with two transverse brownish-red
bands. Irides yellowish-silvery. That portion of the dorsal fin anterior to the fifth
band is white, the remainder, together with the anal and caudal, light-yellowish,
the latter tipped with blackish-brown. The pectorals are orange-red, and the
ventrals are deep blackish-brown.</p>

<p>Length, 7 inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—An extremely rare fish, of which the solitary specimen now before
me is the only example that has come to my notice. It is the more interesting
in a geographical point of view, as being the only species—as near as I can
ascertain—recorded from the Polynesian Seas. Sir John Richardson, in his
interesting “Notices of Australian Fish,” published in the “Proceedings of the
Zoological Society of London,” describes, and gives a list of thirteen species.
Nine of those occur in the Australian Seas, one from China and Japan, two
from the Cape of Good Hope, and one from Tristan d’Acunha. In the number
and arrangement of the fasciae, our fish closely resembles the <i>C. gibbosus</i>, Sol.,
(<i>Chætodon</i>) from Van Diemen’s Land. The latter species is less gibbous, the
eyes smaller, the soft portion of the dorsal fin shorter, and the caudal forks are
more pointed than in the <i>C. vittatus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Apogon</span> Lacep. 1802.</h4>

<h5><i>A. maculiferus</i>, Garrett.</h5>

<p class="center">B. 7; D. 7-1-9; A. 2-8 V. 1-5; P. 13; C. 4, 1, 8, 7, 1, 3.</p>

<p>The upper profile of the head is slightly concave; otherwise the general shape
of the fish closely resembles the <i>Apogon fraenatus</i>, Val. The greatest depth of
the body, taken at the commencement of the anterior dorsal fin, equals the length
of the head, or two-sevenths of the entire length of the fish. The eye is large,
sub-circular in shape, even with the upper line of profile, and its diameter nearly
one-third as long as the head. The upper jaw is slightly the longest, and the
hinder termination of the maxillary is on a line with the posterior border of the
pupil. The margin of the preopercle is finely and regularly dentated, and its
anterior crest or ridge exhibits but few irregular teeth. The lateral line may
be traced over twenty-four scales.</p>

<p>The first and second dorsal fin are of equal length along their base, both being
higher than long, and the altitude of the latter, which exceeds that of the former,
is, as compared to the entire length of the fish, one to five. The anal fin is
inserted a trifle more posterior than the fin above. The large ventrals, when
laid back, cover the vent with their tips. The caudal is sub-bifurcate.</p>

<p>Color brilliant silvery, with an iridescent reflection in which carnation predominates.
The upper two-thirds of the body is ornamented with longitudinal
rows of small olivaceous spots, one on each scale, and those above the lateral
line more or less coalescing, forming broken bands. The head, which is more or
less tinged with diluted carmine-red, is marked by a diffuse olivaceous band,
which extends from the end of the snout, passing through the eye and terminating
on the opercle. Irides silvery white; cornea black. The membranes of
all the fins are tinged with orange-yellow, and their rays are red.</p>

<p>Length, 5½ inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>Vernacular, “Upapalu.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—The longitudinal series of maculations will readily determine this
species. Under the lens the spots assume the appearance of clusters of minute
dots, some of which have blue central points.</p>

<p>In this species the upper and lower outlines are quite similar, being gently
arched. The greatest depth of the body falls slightly short of one-third of the
total length, and the greatest thickness at the base of the head, is a little more
than two-thirds of the above mentioned depth. The head constitutes just one-third
of the whole fish. The eye is large, circular, its diameter being nearly
one-fourth of the length of the head. Four spines may be seen along the upper
edge of the orbit, and the same number on each side of the occipital region and
nape, the posterior one the larger. Two intraorbital spines, one on the nasal
bone, and a longitudinal row of four along the supratympanic region. Two on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the opercle, the lower one long and projecting posterior to the margin of that
bone. A stout one may be observed on the humeral region, one on the infra-orbital,
three on the margin of the preopercle, and a longitudinal row of irregularly
disposed ones along the cheek. The lower jaw is slightly longer than the
upper, and the tip of the maxillary extends as far back as the hinder border of
the eye. Fine scales envelop the basal portions of all the fins except the ventrals,
and cover all parts of the head except the jaws and the lower half of the
maxillary bone. Minute filaments are observed on all parts of the fish, being
more numerous on the upper anterior third of the body. The dorsal and anal
fins are small, the former commencing above the origin of the latter line. The
spiny portion of the dorsal is very low, gently arched, and constitutes nearly
two-thirds of the fin. The soft portion of the anal fin is very narrow and
rounded off.</p>

<p>The head and anterior half of the body is greyish, passing into light carnation
beneath, and obscurely clouded with dusky. The posterior half of the body
is dusky black, which fades into pink beneath, maculated with small darker
spots. Caudal trunk, pink. Two large dusky black spots on the anterior dorsal
region. Irides greenish-yellow. Fins pinky-red, the spiny dorsal mottled with
dusky, and the other fins dotted with pinky-brown, and a bar of the same color
on the caudal base.</p>

<p>Length, 4 inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—The scaly head, small dorsal and anal fin will readily distinguish
this beautiful species.</p>

<p class="center">B. 6; D. 12-10; A. 3-12; V. 1-5; P. 17; C. 2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 2.</p>

<p>The greatest depth, which occurs beneath the origin of the dorsal fin, is about
one-fourth of the total length, and the greatest thickness is just half of the above
mentioned depth. The head, which comprises a little more than one-fourth of
the whole fish, presents a slight concave depression above the eyes. The preopercular
serrations are very small. The eyes are sub-circular, their greatest
diameter entering nearly six times in the length of the head, and twice in advance
of their own orbit. The hinder tip of the maxillary reaches a vertical, passing
through the center of the eye. Twelve longitudinal rows of scales may be
enumerated between the lateral line and the vent, ten rows on the side of the
caudal trunk, and the median longitudinal row on the body contains thirty
scales. The lateral line, which passes over thirty-three scales, consists of slightly
branched tubes.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin extends over a base equal to half the length of the fish, caudal
fin excluded. Its soft portion falls slightly short of one-third of the whole fin.
The anal fin, which is nearly half as long as the dorsal, has its hinder termination
slightly more posterior. The acuminately pointed ventrals, when closely
appressed to the abdomen nearly reach the anal fin. The large caudal has its
posterior upper and lower angles considerably prolonged and pointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Color purplish-brown, passing into bluish grey beneath, and obsoletely lineated
longitudinally with darker. A large oblong pale diffuse spot beneath the posterior
end of the dorsal fin, which is directed obliquely downward and forward.
Irides silvery, tinged with yellow. The dorsal fin is pale greyish, marked anteriorly
with a large diffuse blue-black spot, its soft portion being tinged with
reddish and margined above with yellow. The anal, ventrals and caudal are
bluish-grey, the former posteriorly tinged with faded red and edged with yellow.
Pectorals nearly colorless.</p>

<p>Length, 18 inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—We have obtained only two individuals of this large species, both
of which were exposed for sale in the Honolulu fish-market. The colors, which
are no doubt considerably changed, were taken from the dead fish.</p>

<p class="center">D. 3-12; A. 6; V. 5; P. 10; C. 1, 7. 1.</p>

<p>The head constitutes about one-third of the total length, caudal excluded.
The eyes are elliptically-oval, and inserted just once their greatest diameter distant
from the margin of the upper jaw. The skin is covered with fine closely
set prickly asperities, which gives it a velvety appearance. The general outline
is ovate, and the greatest thickness equals one-sixth of the entire length. A
range of conspicuous pores commences on the upper part of the gill covers,
curving downward and upward to the symphysis of the lower jaw. Another
row follows the margin of the upper jaw, passing over the snout, where it
branches off posteriorly, curving over the eye and disappearing on the posterior
portion of the body. Each pore is encircled with brush-like appendages, which
gives them a tufted appearance. The dorsal fin extends over a base equal to
one-third the length of the fish. Its upper margin is arched, and its height as
compared to length is as one to two. The height and length of the anal fin are
about equal.</p>

<p>Color deep black and obsoletely maculated with rather small roundish darker
spots. On the basal portion of the dorsal and anal fins may be observed two
large ocellations, with deep black pupils and paler areolae. Very minute
opaque white points may also be seen scattered along the lower parts. Eyes
blackish.</p>

<p>Length, 3½ inches.</p>

<p>Habitat, Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—This species possesses the nasal tufted bristle and two horn-like
processes that we observe in all the species inhabiting these seas. When handled
it emits a most disagreeable odor.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—Exceedingly variable, but the general pattern, as preserved in alcohol,
consists of a series of vertical bands, alternating with spots of various
shapes and sizes, and often densely mottled with dark and light blotches distributed
regularly, but not describable. The fins have alternating bands, and
in all the specimens the membrane between the third and fourth dorsal spine is
as clear as glass, as if intended to be seen through, but probably shines in the
water as a sort of signal. When fresh the colors of those from San Diego were
as follows: 1st, dark brown, a purple lateral stripe, sides with dark and light
brown bars, having silvery blotches between them; below yellowish, top and
sides of head blotched with yellow, a bright red ring with a green centre near
pectorals, and another near caudal. Dorsal with alternating bars of olive and
yellow; pectoral yellow at base, its rays reddish, barred with purple, ventrals
and anal smoky.</p>

<p>Another was striped and cross-barred with brown, and mingled with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
pattern were blotches of olive-brown, yellowish and purple, but no rings. Fins
marked like the body, but paler.</p>

<p>It is possible that the rings observed in the first one, and not seen in any
other, were caused by the growth of vegetable parasites, which are often found
on fish of similar habits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—This is the first instance of a <i>Myxodes</i> being found on our coast
north of the equator, though a nearly allied genus, the <i>Heterostichus</i>, has been
long known. I was in some doubt whether to refer the fish to <i>Myxodes</i> on
account of the meagre descriptions of the genus accessible, but having sent a
copy of the outline to Mr. Gill, I have been confirmed in the correctness of the
diagnosis. The following are some of the most important generic characters
not shown in the outline of our species:</p>

<p>Branchiæ VI-VI, the apertures freely connected below. Teeth uniserial in
each jaw, those of lower jaw largest, some of those along sides larger than the
rest. No teeth on vomer. Scales minute, entire, cycloid, closely adherent—none
on head or fins.</p>

<p>The two-lobed form of the spinous dorsal does not apparently exist in some
of the species. Suspecting that some of the other characters will be found
sufficient to distinguish it, I propose for it provisionally the name <span class="smcap">Gibbonsia</span>,
in honor of Dr. W. P. Gibbons, of Alameda County, whose descriptions
of our viviparous fishes, published in 1854, by the Academy, have only of late
been awarded the credit they deserve.</p>

<p>These beautiful little fish are found at low water in holes among rocks along
our coast south of Point Conception, and at the adjoining islands. Their
varied and elegant coloration would make them beautiful objects for a marine
aquarium, but I had nothing suitable for the purpose, in which I could keep
them alive long enough to study their habits.</p>

<p>I obtained three at Pt. Loma, San Diego, three at Catalina I., and two at
Santa Barbara I., all manifestly of the same species, though differing individually
in color, as above mentioned. They have no popular name.</p>

<p><i>Generic characters.</i>—Form moderately elongated, laterally compressed. Head
depressed, broader than body, forming more than one-fourth of total length.
Eyes small, situated far forward, and obliquely turned upward. Mouth moderate,
its gape extending to the vertical of the posterior rim of orbit, but the
angle of lower jaw half way to branchial aperture. Upper maxillaries extending
back the same distance, thence prolonged by a cartilaginous expansion
which reaches as far back as the opercular opening, and being there connected
to an expansion of the skin of the lower jaw, forms a channel running back from
the mouth and as long as the gape of the mouth itself. This channel is entirely
free from the side of head, but only slightly movable forwards, so that it cannot
serve to widen the mouth when opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Premaxillaries not protractile, movable at their symphysis, and only half as
long as maxillaries, with which they are connected by a thin membrane, ending
below orbit.</p>

<p>Villiform teeth on premaxillaries throughout, also on lower maxillaries to
angle of mouth, and on pharyngeals; none on upper maxillaries, vomer or
palate. A minute nasal aperture close behind maxillary and another opening
just in front of anterior rim of orbit.</p>

<p>Preoperculum covered by the skin of the head.</p>

<p>Branchiæ four, all double, and free, opercular apertures small, as wide as
base of pectorals, and separated by the whole width of the base of head.</p>

<p>Tongue broad and thick. Air-bladder small, liver very large and alimentary
canal short.</p>

<p>Scales small, cycloid and thin, imbedded in the skin so as to be scarcely perceptible
anterior to dorsal fin, or on back. None on ventral surface.</p>

<p>No lateral line perceptible. Dorsal fins two, situated far back, and rather
large. Caudal small, obtusely rounded. Anal opposite to second dorsal. Ventrals
united into a funnel-shaped disk opposite base of pectorals. Pectorals
large and rounded. Fin rays all soft, dividing into three or four branches
toward their ends. A small “<i>papilla genitalis</i>” in front of anal fin.</p>

<p>Whole fish covered with thick mucous secretion. Skin of head rather loose
and soft, and perfectly smooth.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—When alive mottled with light and dark olive, paler below, sides of
head reddish. In alcohol black, pale below, and scales below middle of sides
finely punctate each with 8-10 dots, only visible under a microscope.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i>—I found these remarkable fish only in San Diego Bay, and in but one
station, which was among seaweed growing on small stones at the wharf of
Newtown the military post, in November, 1861. They were left by the receding
of the tide, and must have been out of the water from three to six hours
daily, though kept moist by the seaweed. The four obtained were all females
containing large masses of ova, and may have come to the spot in order to
deposit them.</p>

<p>I could not obtain a glass vessel suitable for an aquarium, so as to keep them
alive and observe their habits. The use of the strange maxillary processes or
channels is obscure, nothing analogous being known in other fishes, the nearest
approach to them being apparently the lengthened maxillaries of some <i>Salmonidæ</i>
and <i>Clupeidæ</i>, fish of entirely different habits and affinities, this one being
evidently one of the <i>Gobidæ</i>. The stomach contained small crabs, apparently
swallowed whole.</p>

<p><i>Colors.</i>—Thickly marbled with blackish and grayish mottlings equal in
size; ventrals and tail with a few scattered white spots; below, white. It is
probable that the colors are variable, as in the allied <i>Urolophus</i>.</p>

<p>I was doubtful at first whether to consider this fish a <i>Pteroplatea</i>, as that
genus is described by Richardson as having the mouth curved, and the dental
plate extending to its corners, also the teeth lobed. These characters, however,
may change with its growth, this being evidently a young specimen. Mr.
Gill, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., to whom I sent a
figure of it, agrees with me in referring it to this genus.</p>

<p>Compared with the <i>P. Maclura</i> (Lesueur), of the Atlantic coast, described and
figured by Dekay in the Nat. History of New York, this species is less wide
in proportion to its length, the difference being as 10 to 16. There is also
some difference in the markings. The <i>P. Maclura</i> is said to attain the enormous
width of 18 feet.</p>

<p>I found but one specimen of this fish at San Diego, where it was caught in
a seine. I have also seen one, when the steamer was lying at anchor, at San
Pedro, swimming near the surface of the water, apparently supporting itself by
flapping its wing-like expansions, while it progressed slowly by lateral motions
of its tail.</p>

<h3>Descriptions of Nine New Species of Helix Inhabiting
California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. NEWCOMB, M.D., OF OAKLAND, CAL.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Helix L.</span></h4>

<h5><i>Helix Hillebrandi</i> Newc.</h5>

<p>H. testa supra planulata, luteo-cornea, sub-carinata, fasciis albis bi-cingulata,
sub-lente crebre granulata, hirsuta; anfractibus 6 undique minute striatis,
striis oblique transversis; anfr. ultimo descendente; umbilico late-aperto;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
apertura lunari-ovale; peristomate tenuo, albo, reflexo, prope umbilicam
expanso.</p>

<p>Lat. maj. 0.9, min. 0.8 pol. Alt. 0.35 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Tuolumne County, California.</p>

<p>Shell sub-planulate above, yellowish horn color, sub-carinate, under the glass
thickly granulate, hairy(?); whorls 6 very finely striate, striæ obliquely transverse;
the last whorl descending; umbilicus broadly open; aperture lunate
oval; lip thin, white and reflected, near the umbilicus expanded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—But one recent specimen, with a number in a fossil state, were
collected by M. Voy and kindly placed in my hands. The granulated surface
is confined to the epidermis, and the summit of many of the granules is marked
with a cicatrix indicating a hirsute character. The nearest allied species is
<i>H. Dupetit-Thouarsi</i>, from which it differs in its more depressed form and surface
structure. It is dedicated to Wm. Hillebrand, M.D., of Honolulu, a well-known
naturalist.</p>

<h5><i>Helix Tryoni</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 1098.</h5>

<p>H. testa solida, depresso-globosa, anguste obtecte umbilicata, supra cæruleo-cinerea,
infra sordido-alba, spira sub-turbinata; anfr. 6 convexi, ultimus descendens;
striæ sub-lente numerosæ insculptæ circum-volutæ; apertura sub-rotundata;
columella callosa, obsolete unidentata; peristoma vix reflexum, introrsum
callosum.</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 1, min. 0.88 pol. Alt. 0.75 pol.</p>

<p><i>Var. b</i>, anfr. superiores undis transversis albis.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Insulis “Santa Barbara,” et “San Nicolas,” Cal.</p>

<p>Shell solid, depressly globose, umbilicus narrow and covered, above of an
ashy sky-blue, below of a dirty white; spire sub-turbinate; suture well
impressed, whorls 6 convex; numerous microscopical striæ, sculptured and
revolving with the whorls; aperture rounded; columella callous, obsoletely
one (sometimes two) toothed; lip scarcely reflected, thickened within; <i>var. b</i>,
superior whorls with white transverse undulating lines.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Santa Barbara, and San Nicolas Islands, Cal.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>This species was found in great abundance alive. The animal is of a deep
smoky hue, almost black, with <i>sometimes</i> the terminal half-inch of the foot of a
dirty white. It is dedicated to a distinguished American Conchologist.</p>

<h5><i>Helix crebri-striata</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 1036.</h5>

<p>H. testa obtecte vel aperte umbilicata, turbine-depresse-globosa, translucido-cornea;
anfr. 5 convexiusculi, ultimo descendente; apice sub-mamillato; sutura
bene impressa; striæ transversæ valde et creberrime insignæ, striæ longitudinis
microscopice incisæ; apertura sub-rotunda; peris. diverso (tenue, acute,
sub-reflexo, vel crasso intus calloso) approximato cum callo profuso conjuncto,
vel sine callo; prope umbilicam expanso.</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 0.92, min. 0-75 pol. Alt. 0-55 ad 0-80 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Ins. “San Clemente,” Cal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Shell with a covered or open umbilicus, turbinately depressly globose, whorls
5 a little convex, the last descending; suture well impressed; transverse striæ
well and densely shown, longitudinal striæ fine and impressed; aperture rounded;
peristome various (thin, acute, a little reflected, or heavy, with an interior
thickening) approximate, with (or without) a profuse callus connecting the
outer and inner lips; near the umbilicus the columellar lip expands so as to partially
cover the perforation.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Clemente Island, Cal. Abundant.</p>

<p>This shell, so difficult to describe, owing to its variable characters in different
specimens, makes the nearest approach to <i>H. Kelletii</i> Forbes, from which it may
readily be distinguished by its sculpture and other characters. In size and the
elevation of the spire, it is one of the most variable of the California species
of Helix. Distinguished from <i>H. intercisa</i> W. G. Binney, by its not being
<i>solid</i>, having the umbilicus partially or completely <i>open</i>, and from the figure
referred to, in being more depressly trochiform in shape. The locality of <i>H.
intercisa</i> is given as “Oregon Territory.” The shell varies in some minor particulars,
as in the want of a rufous apex, and its not being of the same color;
in other respects it seems to be a closely allied species.</p>

<h5><i>Helix rufocincta</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 624.</h5>

<p>H. testa depresso-globosa, cornea, rufo-unifasciata, umbilicata, sub-lente decussata-striata;
anfr. 6 ultimus non descendens; apertura sub-rotundo, labio reflexo,
albo; sutura impressa; columella non callosa.</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 0.70, min. 0.60 pol. Alt. 0.40 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Diego, et Insula “Santa Catalina,” Cal.</p>

<p>Shell depressly globose, horny, red-banded, umbilicate, under the lens decussately
striate; whorls 6, the last not descending; aperture sub-rotund; lip
white, reflected; suture impressed; columella not callous.</p>

<p>The adult of this species is allied in outline to <i>H. Pytyonesica</i> Pfr., but is
less elevated, and bears in other respects no especial relation to that species.
The size varies considerably, and the umbilicus in some specimens is nearly
closed, while in the typical specimens it is quite open.</p>

<p>But one dead specimen was found at San Diego; but on Catalina Island it
was more common, 19 adult and mostly living specimens occurring, æstivating
on the under surface of stones, in June.</p>

<h5><i>Helix Gabbii</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 1097.</h5>

<p>H. testa sub-obtecte umbilicata, tenuis, pallide cornea, depresso-orbicularis,
fusco obscure zonata; anfr. 5 convexis ultimus descendens; sutura bene impressa;
apertura sub-orbiculari; labro albo non calloso, reflexo.</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 0.40, min. 0.35 pol. Alt. 0.20 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Insul. “San Clemente,” Cal.</p>

<p>Shell with umbilicus partially covered, thin, pale corneous, depressly orbicular,
with an indistinct brown band; whorls 5 convex, the last descending; lip
white, not thickened, reflected.</p>

<p>I have seen but a solitary specimen of this species. The size corresponds
nearly with <i>H. facta</i>, but the thinness of the shell, the color, the more rounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
whorls, the deeper suture, and the thin, white, reflected lip, sufficiently characterize
this as a distinct species.</p>

<h5><i>Helix facta</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 1099.</h5>

<p>H. testa obtecte rimata, depresso-orbiculari, solida, compacta, glabra, albida,
fusco-rubro uni-zonata; anfr. 5 ad 5½ convexiusculi, ultimus descendens; sutura
modice impressa; apertura ovalis; labro crasso, reflexo, flavido.</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 0.42, min. 0.35 pol. Alt. 0.22 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Insul. “Santa Barbara,” et “San Nicolas.”</p>

<p>Shell with perforation covered, depressed orbicular, solid, <i>compact</i>, smooth,
whitish, zoned with a brownish red band; whorls 5 to 5½ somewhat convex,
the last descending; suture slightly impressed; aperture oval; lip thick,
reflected, yellowish.</p>

<p>A sub-fossil variety measures 0.60 by 0.32 inches. Very numerous on Santa
Barbara Island; less so on San Nicolas.</p>

<p>This species differs so essentially from the ordinary type of California Helices
as to suggest a tropical region as its original habitat. One character in common
with many of our species may be noticed, viz.: the colored band cutting
the body whorl, inclosed between two faint light colored cinctures.</p>

<p>The shell has a little the aspect of <i>H. Rothi</i> Pfr., from the Island of Syra,
but is smaller, less elevated, and with a thick reflected yellow lip.</p>

<h5><i>Helix Whitneyi</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 1112.</h5>

<p>H. testa corneo-fumosa, sub-planulata, polita umbilico perspectivo; sutura
bene impressa; apertura lunaris; labro simplici; anfr. 4.</p>

<p>Diam. 0.20 pol. Alt. 0.10 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> prope “Lake Taho,” Cal., in montibus “Sierra Nevada,” elevatione
6100 ped. Angl.</p>

<p>Shell smoky horn color, nearly flat above, smooth, with a perspective umbilicus;
suture well impressed; aperture lunate; lip simple; whorls four.</p>

<p>In the umbilicus resembling <i>H. striatella</i> Anthony, with a smooth surface
and a dull, smoky hue. Only three specimens were found, under damp logs and
bark along a mountain stream, together with <i>H. Breweri</i>, and <i>chersina</i>.</p>

<h5><i>H. Breweri</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 1113.</h5>

<p>H. testa discoidea, pallide-cornea, nitida, lucida; sutura sub-canaliculata,
late umbilicata; anfr. 5. apertura lunaris; labro tenue simplici.</p>

<p>Diam. 0.20 pol. Alt 0.10 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> prope “Lake Taho,” Cal., et montibus septentrionalibus.</p>

<p>Shell discoidal, pale corneous, shining, transparent, suture slightly channelled,
broadly umbilicate; whorls 5; aperture lunate; lip thin, simple.</p>

<p>This shell may be compared with <i>H. arborea</i> Say, from which it differs by its
less elevation, more polished and lighter colored surface, and more open umbilicus.
Eight specimens found; one from Northern California, by Prof. Brewer.</p>

<h5><i>Helix Duranti</i> Newc. State Collection, Species 987.</h5>

<p>H. testa depressa, discoidea, pallide-cornea sub-lente minutissime striata,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
opaca, late et perspective umbilicata; anfr. 4. ultimus declivis non descendens;
sutura linearis; apertura rotundata-lunaris; peristomate simplici, approximato.</p>

<p>Diam. 0.20 pol. Alt. 0.07 pol.</p>

<p><i>Hab</i>. “Santa Barbara Island.”</p>

<p>Shell depressed, discoidal, pale corneous, under the lens minutely striated,
opaque, broadly and perspectively umbilicated; whorls 4, the last shelving but
not descending (at the aperture); suture linear; aperture rounded, lunate, lip
simple, the external and internal approximating.</p>

<p>This pretty little planorboid Helix bears a striking resemblance to <i>Planorbis
albus</i> Müller, (<i>hirsutus</i> Gould,) especially in its upper aspect. Beneath, the
whorls are less distinctly shown than in the <i>Planorbis</i>. I take pleasure in dedicating
this species to Professor Henry Durant, of the College of California.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the State Collection contains the following
species of Californian Helices:</p>

<p><i>Helix arrosa</i> Gould, sps. 858, common near mouth of S. F. Bay. Also a
yellow variety from Santa Cruz, Mr. Rowell.</p>

<h3>Description of a New Species of Virgularia from the
Coast of California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. M. GABB.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Virgularia Lam.</span></h4>

<h5><i>V. gracilis</i> Gabb.</h5>

<p>Polypidom long and very slender. Decorticated stem circular or elliptical in
section, smooth on the surface. Polypiferous lobes, slender, exsert, lunate, acute
at the tips and broad at the base; arranged obliquely and alternately on the
antero-lateral face of the stem. These lobes occupy the upper half of the
polypidom; retaining their full size to the extreme apex, but diminishing below,
so that on the middle of the stem they are exceedingly minute; and an inch or
two below, are only represented by a slight ridge on the sheath, in which are
two or three cells. The lower fourth of the sheath is dilated to about three
times the thickness of the rest of the stem.</p>

<p>Length 19 inches; diameter of the naked stem .03 in.; smallest diameter of
stem, with the sheath, .04; diameter of expanded base .13 in.; length of
largest lobes .15 in.</p>

<p>Locality, Bay of Monterey, 20 fms. Collected by Dr. J. G. Cooper, of the
State Geological Survey.</p>

<p>This species can be at once distinguished from <i>V. elongata</i>, G. (Proc. Cal. A.
N. S., vol. 2, p. 167) by its more slender form, its proportionally large polypiferous
lobes, its cylindrical stem, without any grooves, and by the comparatively
smaller portion of the stem bearing the lobes.</p>

<h3>Notice of Plants found Growing in Hot Springs in California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PROF. WM. H. BREWER, OF THE STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.</p>

<p>More than two years ago I laid before this Society some facts in regard to
the growth of plants in the thermal waters of this State. Since that time we
have more observations, and some of the facts are worthy of record, although
the fact is not new that plants will grow in hot water.</p>

<p>At the Geysers in Lake County, there are numerous hot springs and steam
jets, in and around which there is an abundant growth of a low form of vegetation
(<i>Nostoc</i>?) growing on the soil and covering it with a bright green coating.
In some of the warm springs and streams it accumulates in considerable quantities
in the water. The highest temperature of water observed at the time of
our visit, in 1861, was 207° F.; the water of many of the springs boiling
violently at temperatures ranging from 196° to that stated. This vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
flourished in waters of the temperature of 200° F., but was most abundant
where the temperature ranged from 125° to 140° F. It coated the soil around
the steam jets, where it would be alternately exposed to the jets of steam issuing
at a higher temperature than that of boiling water, and of the cooler air.</p>

<p>In water of the temperatures of 100° to 125° there are filamentons algæ.</p>

<p>At the Little Geysers similar facts were observed.</p>

<p>In Plumas County, near Lassens Peak, there are three groups of hot springs,
at all of which the same form of vegetation is abundant under similar conditions,
especially around steam jets. Various gases, especially sulphohydric and
sulphurous acids, accompanying the steam in all of these localities, and the soil
is generally impregnated with various saline substances. All the specimens of
the plants were unfortunately lost, so that no microscopic examination has been
made, further than could be done on the spot with a pocket lens.</p>

<p>Near all of these springs, the <i>Panicum thermale</i> Bolander, grows on the
saline soils, sometimes where the soil is warm and the grass is subjected to
steam; but its station appears to depend more upon the saline character of the
soil than upon its temperature. It was frequently found on soil saturated with
sulphates of soda, lime, etc., and having a strongly acid reaction.</p>

<p>None of these forms are universally found about all the hot springs of the
State; many springs have been visited where neither of them occur, but where
one is found the other is generally found also.</p>

<p>Shell depressly globose, crimson colored, minutely transversely striated,
above rounded, below broadly open; lip expanded, semicircular; columella
thick, dilated within, straight; aperture elongately sub-ovate; extremities
broadly notched.</p>

<p>The Genus Pedicularia was established by Swainson for the reception of a
single species (<i>P. sicula</i>) of that author. During the past year another species
has been added by that eminent Naturalist, G. P. Deshayes, of Paris.</p>

<p>In a work published, on the shells of the Isle of Bourbon, he describes a beautiful
violet-colored species under the name of <i>P. elegantissima</i>. The California
species (of which only one specimen has been obtained) can scarcely be
surpassed in brilliancy by its Indian Ocean congener, although bearing the
exquisite name of <i>elegantissima</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>For the specimen of the species here described, I am indebted to the extreme
liberality of D. N. Robinson, Esq., of San Francisco, who obtained it from a
coral growing on a monster crustacean of the genus <i>Echidnocerus</i>, which was
taken in very deep water at the Farallones Islands.</p>

<h3>On Californian Lepidoptera. No. IV.</h3>

<p class="center">BY H. BEHR, M.D.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fam. Vanessidæ.</span></h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Grapta.</span></h5>

<h6><i>Grapta Comma</i> Harris.</h6>

<p>I possess but one specimen of this Grapta. It was collected by Dr. Hillebrand,
in Yosemite Valley, during his late visit to California. It agrees in all
essential points with two other specimens which I obtained through the kindness
of Mr. W. H. Edwards, of New York. The California specimen differs
by a somewhat lighter coloration on both sides, especially below where the
ground color passes into a yellowish brown, while in the Eastern specimen it
becomes a bluish gray. On the upper side, also, the bluish coloration of the
edge of the angulated wings of the Eastern form is replaced by a yellowish
tint.</p>

<p>I would be inclined to take <i>G. Comma</i> for a local variety of <i>G. C-album</i>,
were it not for the caterpillar, which, according to Mr. Harris, resembles that
of <i>G. interrogationis</i>, and is entirely without that strangely dimidiate coloration
so characteristic in <i>G. C-album</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>G. C-album</i> I cannot find any difference between my Californian and
European specimens. Our vernal generation is larger and somewhat lighter
colored than any European specimens I have ever seen. The caterpillar has a
curious dimidiate coloration, which I have never seen except in this species:
the fore part being white, the abdominal part yellow. I found it on Urtica,
but it will probably be found on other Urticaceous plants, herbaceous as well
as arborescent. <i>G. C-album</i> is not common in the immediate neighborhood of
San Francisco, but it is rather abundant in woody and mountainous districts.</p>

<p>The Atlantic States are richer in species of this genus than either Europe or
California, the two latter of which possess the same number of species.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Vanessa</span> Fabr.</h5>

<h6><i>Vanessa Californica</i> Boisd.</h6>

<p>The caterpillar of this species feeds on Ceanothus, and lives socially like that
of <i>V. Urticæ</i> L., from which it differs very little. It is of a velvety black, and
the spines which cover it are also black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>V. Californica</i> is remarkable from its being one of the few wandering Lepidoptera
yet known. The first migration I observed was on November 15th,
1856, when numbers of this butterfly flew over San Francisco in a general
direction of south-south-east. They flew singly, and never crowded into
swarms. Most of these butterflies passed over our streets at too great a height
to permit close inspection—a few alighting here and there on lamp-posts, sign-boards,
or in the more rural parts, on flowers. It was from these that I
obtained the specimens in my collection. They nearly all looked worn and
shattered, and there were no fresh specimens among them: clearly indicating
that they were not raised in the neighborhood of the city, but had come
from distant parts. On the 18th some of the stragglers were still to be seen,
but on the 19th they had all disappeared. The second migration took place
last fall, but did not reach San Francisco. I received a series of specimens,
caught by Dr. Cooper, on the road to Lake Taho. Others I received from
Oregon, where they were collected by Mr. Gabb, during his geological examination
of those northern regions. Neither Dr. Cooper nor Mr. Gabb observed
any marked direction in the flight of these butterflies; they agree that the
species was strikingly numerous. Mr. Gabb represents it as settling on the
ground in dry arroyos, very shy, and when frightened, always returning to the
same spot—a behavior which pretty nearly corresponds with that of the nearest
relative, the European <i>V. Polychloros</i>. Both of these authorities prove merely an
unusual number of this butterfly at an unusual time of the year. The description
of the habits of the insect, as observed by Mr. Gabb in the Umpqua Valley,
show clearly that there it felt at home. By comparing notes received from
Mr. Johnson, of Marin County, I have come to the conclusion that the country
to the northward, crowded with this Vanessa, must have sent at least one colony
south; and I was told by the above-mentioned gentleman, the statement being
confirmed by several intelligent farmers of the same neighborhood, that large
numbers of a brown butterfly had come from San Quentin, and crossed over
that part of the bay which stretches between San Rafael and Saucelito.
About the same time, great numbers of the same insect were observed in Lagunita
Valley, at the base of Tamal Pais, where the swarms gathered in a great
crowd, and disappeared as suddenly as they came.</p>

<p>I trust that my loquacity in regard to the habits of this species will be pardoned.
I consider the observation of facts touching the migration of animals,
of the highest importance, and think it desirable that all observations on these
points should be put on record: so that hereafter, when a sufficient number of
instances may have been collected, conclusions may be drawn, and perhaps many
hitherto inexplicable points in the geographical distribution of insects, and of
organic life in general, may be explained.</p>

<p>This butterfly is rather rare in common years, and is, perhaps, notwithstanding
its name, <i>V. Californica</i>, not exactly an indigenous species, at least not in
the middle counties of our State. Unlike all other <i>Vanessidæ</i> known to me, it
has but one generation, at least in California, where the imago is always found
late in the season. I do not venture to decide whether <i>V. Californica</i> requires
a longer time for development in the larva state than the other <i>Vanessidæ</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
whether it has its vernal generations somewhere else in adjacent countries. I
have found but one colony of caterpillars. It was in July, and most of the
individuals were nearly full grown; they were rather delicate, the majority died
in the larva state, seven transformed about the end of the month, and a single
chrysalis produced a crippled butterfly.</p>

<h6><i>Vanessa Milberti</i> Godt.</h6>

<p>This species is common in woody localities. The caterpillar is very much
like that of <i>V. Californica</i>, and only a few individuals show a distinguishing
mark in the shape of a longitudinal, lateral stripe of sulphur yellow. It feeds
on <i>Urtica</i>.</p>

<h6><i>Vanessa Antiopa</i> L.</h6>

<p>There is nothing to add in regard to this long and well-known species. The
caterpillar feeds here, as everywhere else, on willows.</p>

<p>The true Vanessæ have about the same geographical distribution as the Graptæ.
They also have a predilection for Urticaceous plants. Only the most
northern species is amphigeic.</p>

<p>There is a balance in favor of the Old World—the beautiful type of <i>V. Io</i>
not being represented on this continent—and also the type of <i>V. Polychloros</i>,
containing a few species, as, for instance, <i>V. Xanthomelas</i>, that make it appear
more numerous.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Pyrameis</span> Hubn.</h5>

<h6><i>Pyrameis Atalanta</i> L.</h6>

<p>Larva feeds on Urtica.</p>

<h6><i>Pyrameis Carye.</i></h6>

<p>This species is by far the most common butterfly in California. The caterpillar
is very variable in its coloration, and is so like that of <i>P. Atalanta</i>, in
company with which it is frequently found, that I have never succeeded in finding
any distinguishing characters. It feeds throughout the year on <i>Urtica</i> and
on several malvaceous plants, and has the habit of all its congeners, of hiding
itself in a rolled up leaf.</p>

<h6><i>Pyrameis Cardui</i> L.</h6>

<p>This most cosmopolitan of all diurnals, affects here, in its larva state, several
malvaceous plants, and also the genus <i>Gnaphalium</i>, and its relations; but the
plant for which it shows the greatest predilection is <i>Silybum Marianum</i>, a
plant which formerly did not exist here, and has only spread since 1852. It now
forms thickets in the neighborhood of San Francisco, as well as near most of
our inland towns, but has never spread to a great distance from settlements.
<i>P. Cardui</i> frequents the same localities, and I found the same species in Australia
in the same relation to the same immigrated plant, <i>Silybum Marianum</i>.
I know very well that <i>P. Cardui</i> existed here, as well as in Australia, before
the immigration of this Mediterranean plant; but still, it is a remarkable fact
that this cosmopolitan butterfly, notwithstanding its ability to adapt itself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
plants of the most different families, still clings with such tenacity to a cosmopolitan
plant, to whose universal distribution it is perhaps much indebted for
the wide range which it itself attains.</p>

<p>Next to the cosmopolitan character of this plant, <i>P. Cardui</i> owes its great
extent probably to its many generations and certain irregularities in the time
of the appearance of the perfect insect; so that small colonies of the species
are not so liable to be destroyed by inclemency of climate or exceptional atmospheric
agencies; for a being that exists at the same time in the four stages of
the egg, larva, chrysalis, and imago, has more chances of escaping cataclysms
and deluge than others that are all at one time in the same stage of existence.
The extent of the influence exerted by the number of generations, and the irregularity
of period, can be very clearly recognized by the circumstance that
species with one generation are always the most local; for instance, certain
<i>Meliteæ</i>, <i>Argynnidæ</i>, <i>Theclæ</i>, most of <i>Sphingidæ</i>, etc.; that also the cosmopolitanism
develops in proportion to the number of generations, and attains its
maximum in certain <i>Vanessidæ</i>, <i>Danaidæ</i>, <i>Pyrameis</i>, etc.</p>

<h6><i>Pyrameis Hunteri</i> Fab.</h6>

<p>This species seems to have, in California, but one generation. It is not common.
I have found it only in the latter part of the season, and have not yet
succeeded in finding the caterpillar. The genus <i>Pyrameis</i> has the widest range
of all the genera of this family. It extends through all latitudes from the
Arctic regions to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn. On the northern
hemispheres it is best represented in California, which country possesses one
peculiar species in addition to all three of Europe and the Eastern Slope of the
United States.</p>

<h6><i>Junonia Cænia</i> Boisd. et Lee.</h6>

<p>Several generations. Caterpillar not yet found in California. From this
enumeration of California <i>Vanessidæ</i> we find, 1st. That with the exception of
<i>V. Californica</i>, there is not yet found any species of this group peculiar to our
State, for even <i>P. Carye</i> exists as well in Chili as here, and is also said to have
been found in Brazil. This circumstance is more striking since our <i>Argynnidæ</i>
and <i>Meliteæ</i> prove altogether local; none of them being identical with Eastern
species, unless a <i>Melitæa</i>, of the type of <i>Mylitta</i>, should be found identical
with a form found in Texas. 2. The genera of this group, north of the
Tropic of Cancer, are essentially amphigeic, the European <i>Arachnia</i> being
almost the sole exception. But, as it were, to compensate this, the tropical
amphigeic genus <i>Junonia</i>, wanting in Europe, extends, on our continent, to high
latitudes. 3. As regards the number of specks, the genus <i>Grapta</i> predominates
at the Eastern Slope, <i>Vanessa</i> in Europe, <i>Pyrameis</i> in California, and our own
<i>Junonia</i> is counterbalanced in Europe by our <i>Arachnia</i>.</p>

<h3>Earthquakes in California During the Year 1863.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JOHN B. TRASK, M.D.</p>

<p>During the year 1863 we have had but five earthquakes, and as in former
years they have been marked by no serious event, if we except the light degree
of fright induced at the time among our people.</p>

<p>January 25th.—A severe shock was experienced at San Diego at 2h. 20m.
<span class="smcapuc">M.</span>, which lasted five to eight seconds. There was no undulation in this case,
it consisting of a series of sharp jars. It was preceded by a deep rumbling
noise.</p>

<p>February 1st.—A very smart shock at the Mission San Juan, Monterey
County, at 4h. 1m. <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> This shock was felt at Gilroys at 4h. 15m. This
town is twelve miles east of the former. At both places the shock was marked
by the undulatory motion. It was not observed at Monterey, which is nearly
twelve miles west of the Mission.</p>

<p>June——A smart shock at midnight at San Francisco.</p>

<p>August 1st.—Two light shocks at San Francisco, at 10h. 48m. <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, and at
11h. 6m. <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, another shock.</p>

<p>December 19th.—At 2h. 38m. <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> a smart shock was felt throughout the
city; directly afterwards another and more severe one occurred. The first was
a short, sudden jar, while the second was undulatory. The accuracy of the
telegraph operator at Santa Clara has enabled us to form a correct idea of the
course of this shock, and to correct to some extent the popular errors relating
to the direction of the seismic wave. His time was 2h. 44m. 31s., being
within 29 seconds of true time, which would then be 2.45. This gives us
only 6½ minutes difference in elapsed time, and gives for the direction of the
wave an east course in place of north and south, as reported, which corresponds
to our measured observations here. I take this opportunity of expressing the
thanks of the Academy to this operator for his accuracy and kindness in furnishing
us data in this and other phenomena of scientific and public interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<h4>February and March, 1864.</h4>

<p>During the present year, 1864, we have had two smart earthquakes at the
date of writing this report.</p>

<p>February 26th.—At San Francisco a light shock at 0h. 40m. <span class="smcapuc">M.</span>, and another
at 2h. 10m. <span class="smcapuc">M.</span> These were reported to me by persons who were up in the
south and west parts of the city. At 5h. 47m. a very smart shock occurred,
having three distinct vibrations, which induced many to rise somewhat earlier
than was usual. This earthquake was preceded by a strong <i>electric storm</i> (so
called here), between this city and Visalia; the particulars of which have not as
yet all come to hand. It was followed next day by one of those severe “northers”
with which the people of this State are very familiar. Barometer very
low. This fact is mentioned only on account of the unseasonable period at
which the gale occurred.</p>

<p>This earthquake was felt more severe at San José and Santa Clara than at
this place, and occurred at nearly the same hour.</p>

<p>March 5th.—A severe shock of earthquake at San Francisco at 8h. 49m. <span class="smcapuc">M.</span>
The first wave had a north and south direction and continued 1¾ seconds;
nearly 1¾ seconds elapsed before the second shock, which was at 8h. 49m. 3s.,
and continued 1½ seconds. The second shock was rotatory; the pendulum
swinging north and south from the first shock, began and continued to describe
a short oval or nearly a circle from the effects of the second shock, and continued
thus for more than half an hour, until stopped and brought to rest.
Magnetism was not suspended in this earthquake, nor any other that has
occurred since my instrument was suspended. These observations were made at
the height of twenty feet four inches from the ground. The total of time
included in the shock was nearly five seconds. The farthest point south to
which I have been able to trace its effects is the Mission San Juan, and north to
Sacramento, a distance inclusive of 177 miles. In an easterly direction we have
not traced it east of Stockton, about 60 miles. It was felt at Santa Clara,
Santa Cruz, Gilroys, south of San Francisco, and at Santa Rosa and Petaluma
to the north.</p>

<p>Since the above was in type, advices have been received from Visalia. At
that locality the shock was very smart. The first shock took place at 8h. 45m.
<span class="smcapuc">M.</span>, being four minutes earlier than that at San Francisco. This gives for the
entire distance, north and south (over which the earthquake extended), 257
miles. This extent of latitude, and the almost simultaneous period of time at
which it was observed along the entire line of distance so far as heard from,
leads to the conclusion that its probable centre was south of San Francisco and
nearly in the same longitude. From the violence of its action I feel inclined
to the belief that its centre was in the neighborhood of San José, for all
accounts agree in this one point, that more turbulence of the earth’s surface
occurred in this region during its continuance than at any other place yet
known. At Visalia the first shock was a mere tremor, but was followed by an
undulatory movement when the second shock occurred, which was some three or
four seconds later. This wave moved in an east and west direction at that
place.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Earthquakes in California from 1800 to 1864.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JOHN B. TRASK.</p>

<p>As the subject of earthquakes for some years past has engrossed much of the
attention of scientific observers, I have, at the request of several members of the
Academy, made out a complete report upon the occurrence of those phenomena
upon this coast, as far as personal observation is concerned, and also so far only
as we have authentic records prior to the occupancy of the present State of
California by the American Government.</p>

<p>The present paper contains, probably, all that can be verified, and places the
subject in a form to which future reference may be made by other observers
abroad; thus enabling them and ourselves also, to bring together the statistical
facts which, it may be hoped, will help to form some rational theory in future
years relating to the causal agency of those phenomena, as well as the physical
laws governing their action.</p>

<p>In this paper I have reduced the periods of their occurrence for the thirteen
years past to astronomical time, in all instances where the hour on which the
shocks occurred have been known with certainty, and, without attempting to
combat any theory that has been advanced, or the suggestion of another relating
to their origin, their history has been left as a record of facts, which will
become useful when others of like character accompany them. Our record, in
this State alone has reached a little more than one-tenth of the number on which
M. Mallet has founded his theory of their origin, and which were drawn from all
parts of the world, and although this may seem a large proportion for this district
of country alone since 1850, it is not to be presumed that a greater frequency
of shocks have occurred here than elsewhere, but that the same attention has
not been bestowed in recording their occurrence in other countries where they
are known to be much more frequent and severe than upon our coast.</p>

<p>It might be asked why, if such unquestionable frequency occurs within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
limits of this State we are not subject to momentary destruction from their
effects; the answer to this is found in the preceding paragraph, from which
cause it will be seen that our experience is more apparent than real, relatively,
and farther still, we should find a much greater frequency of shocks, beyond all
doubt, if the instruments for their registry in different parts of the State were
more plentiful than at present.</p>

<p>There is no good reason for the supposition that we are in more danger from
these phenomena than upon the Atlantic border, for the reason that we are so far
removed from the centers of immediate and violent volcanic action, that it would
require dangerous tension of the imagination to place California within the
range of those physical causes which are so conducive to violent, repeated, and
destructive earthquakes. This State cannot be considered more subject to earthquakes
than it is to volcanoes, relatively, and this is said too in the face of our
own records relating to the former. We need have little fear from these disturbances
so long as we are so far removed on either hand from the great
centers, and even from the terminal points of those centers of volcanic disturbance,
from the action of which such disastrous consequences have, and will
again follow to their immediate districts.</p>

<p>A moment’s consideration will convince the most sceptical of the prevailing
fallacy relating to this subject. In the first place, we are situated between two
great termini of active volcanic ranges, the nearest being Colima, 1,200 miles
south, the other on the coast of Alaska, more than 1,300 miles to the north;
the distance inclusive between the points being nearly or perhaps quite 2,600
miles, in which NO active volcanic vents abound, unless we make an exception
of Mounts Hood and St. Helen in Oregon, of which the testimony is somewhat
dubious, and the nearest of which is 700 miles. To the east there are no volcanoes
for a distance of 2,500 miles, and to the west for a much greater distance
than in either of the other directions. This, certainly, should be sufficient to
palliate the fears of the timid, in some degree at least, and to silence in part also
the sensational articles which appear from time to time in the press of this
and the eastern States, as to California being an oven within the range of
active volcanic action, and a volcanic country.</p>

<p>In preparing this paper I have endeavored to obtain, as far as possible, the
most correct information relating to the history of these phenomena in former
years. It is my desire also to correct some of the misrepresentations and statements
current relating to the severity of earthquake shocks in this country
during the earlier periods of its history.</p>

<p>I have at the present time some additional information relating to the great
earthquake of 1812, which did not appear in my first paper on this subject, and
which must now be placed on record. These facts relate more to the phenomena
occurring during that year, rather than to the destruction of the missions,
all of which will be found in their proper place below.</p>

<p>From careful inquiry of the early settlers and residents I cannot learn that
any more than one earthquake has occurred which was in any considerable
degree of a serious character, and but one which has caused the destruction of
either life or property to any extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>This earthquake occurred in the month of September, 1812, and destroyed
the Mission San Juan Capistrano, in Los Angeles County, and the Mission
Purissima (Viejo) in the County of Santa Barbara. The following is the history
of that event as obtained from the older native inhabitants and foreign residents
on the coast at that time.</p>

<p>The day was clear and uncommonly warm; it being Sunday the people had
assembled at San Juan Capistrano for evening service. About half an hour
after the opening of service, an unusual loud, but distant rushing sound was
heard in the atmosphere to the east and also over the water, which resembled
the sound of strong wind, but as it approached no perceptible breeze accompanied
it. <i>The sea was smooth and the air was calm.</i> So distant and loud was
this atmospheric sound that several left the building attracted by its noise.</p>

<p>Immediately following the sound, the first and heaviest shock of the earthquake
occurred, which was sufficiently severe to prostrate the Mission Church of San
Capistrano almost in a body, burying in its ruins the most of those who remained
behind, after the first indication of its approach was heard.</p>

<p>The shock was very sudden and almost without warning, save from the rushing
sound above noted, and to the severity of the first shock at that moment is
to be attributed the loss of life that followed.</p>

<p>The number reported to have been killed outright, is variously estimated from
thirty to forty-five (the largest number of persons agree on the smallest number
of deaths given), but in the absence of records such statements should be received
with many grains of allowance, where memory alone is the only means
left, and the term of forty-three years has elapsed before the period at which this
account was placed on paper. A considerable number are reported to have been
badly injured.</p>

<p>There is a universal agreement on this point with those from whom these
facts were derived, viz.: <i>that the first shock threw down the entire building, and
that a large number of persons were in it at that moment</i>, and under the circumstances
it would be most singular if no deaths were caused by such an event.</p>

<p>It is now nine years since the above facts were published, and in March, 1864,
a writer to me unknown, corroborates this statement relating to that Mission in
these words. “The church thrown down at San Juan Capistrano by an earthquake
in 1812, was a well built-affair of stone and cement. The cupola or
short steeple falling over the church completely destroying the building.”</p>

<p>The motion of the earth is described as having <i>lifted vertically</i>, attended by a
rotatory movement. <i>No undulatory</i> motion is described by any one. Dizziness
and <i>nausea</i> seized almost every person in the vicinity.</p>

<p>A heavy, loud, deep rumbling, accompanied the successive shocks that followed,
which were five in number, all having the motion above described, though
comparatively light in their effects to the first. The sounds attending the phenomena
came apparently from the South and East.</p>

<p>In the valley of San Inez, to the south and west of Santa Barbara, the church
now known as the “Mission Viejo” (La Purissima), was also completely destroyed.
At this locality there were also a number of lives lost, but what
number is as yet very uncertain. The distance between Capistrano and San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Inez is about one hundred and seventy miles. The shock which destroyed this
building occurred about one hour after the former, and the greater portion of the
inhabitants had left the building but a few minutes before it fell, service having
closed. The first shock felt here prostrated the building, as in the preceding case.</p>

<p>A Spanish ship which lay at anchor off San Buenaventura, thirty-eight
miles from Santa Barbara, was much injured by the shock, and leaked to that
extent, that it became necessary to beach her, and remove the most of her cargo.</p>

<p>The writer above quoted corroborates the fact of a ship having been in this
vicinity at the time. The distance of this ship from Santa Barbara is nearly
the same as in my original statement but in a different direction. From the circumstantial
details of the writer as to the ship “Charan,” <i>alias</i>, “Thomas Newland,”
I am inclined to the belief that his statements are more entitled to
adoption than my own; I therefore present his statement also and leave the
reader to adopt either, so far as regards the ship and her position. “At the
same time a Boston ship the Thomas Newland, known before as the Charan,
commanded by Capt. Isaac Whitmore, was lying off the anchorage not far from
the Gaviota Pass, Santa Barbara County.”</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact, and at the same time somewhat remarkable, that the
time which elapsed between the advent of the shocks at Capistrano and San
Inez is widely variant from what we should look for, when the distance apart
and velocity of motion in earthquakes are taken into consideration. If the
velocity of the seismic wave in this earthquake was uniform with those of more
recent times, it should have reached La Purissima in twenty-eight minutes and
fifty seconds in lieu of an hour; but all due allowances must be made for a question
of time in an event of this nature, and also for errors in memory of persons
after the lapse of so many years.</p>

<p>The effect of this earthquake on the sea, in the Bay of Santa Barbara, is described
as follows: “The sea was observed to recede from the shore during the
continuance of the shocks, and left the latter dry for a considerable distance,
when it returned in five or six heavy rollers, which overflowed the plain on
which Santa Barbara is built. The inhabitants saw the recession of the sea, and
being aware of the danger on its return, fled to the adjoining hills near the town
to escape the probable deluge.”</p>

<p>The sea on its return flowed inland a little more than half a mile, and reached
the lower part of the town, doing but little damage, destroying only three small
adobe buildings.</p>

<p>Here again I take the liberty of quoting the late writer above noticed, in
corroboration of its effects upon the sea. “The sea was seen to retire all at
once, and to return in an immense wave, which came roaring and plunging back,
over the beach. This wave penetrated the low lands and gulches a mile from
the shore, forming one of the most terrific sights possible to conceive.”</p>

<p>Very little damage was done to the houses in town from the effects of the
shocks, while the Mission at San Inez was prostrated almost instantly. There
is no evidence that I can find, that this earthquake was felt in San Luis Obispo,
though such has been the report.</p>

<p>In addition to my former paper I will now add some information relating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to this and other earthquakes, touching more particularly a series continuing
through a long period for such phenomena, but preceding the great event of
September of that year.</p>

<p>So far as the archives of the old missions assist us, it is found that from the
foundation of the first mission in 1769, up to the year 1800, a period of thirty-one
years, not an entry was made of these phenomena. In the latter year an
earthquake is recorded as occurring at San Juan Bautista, on the eleventh of
October. On the eighteenth of the same month, at supper time another shock
was felt, and another still at about eleven o’clock on the same night. From the
records of the Presidio of San Francisco, we are able to glean the fact, that
between the twenty-first of June and seventeenth of July, 1808, there occurred
twenty-one shocks of earthquakes at this post.</p>

<p>I will here correct the popular error relating to this earthquake or series of
earthquakes during that year. It is generally stated that this was contemporaneous
with the earthquake which destroyed San Juan Capistrano and La
Purissima; by reference to the dates it will be seen that the destruction of
those missions did not occur until four years later.</p>

<p>The above are the only records of these phenomena that have as yet made
their appearance in the archives of the province during the existence of the
Mexican Government; and, from the fact that these archives are all in our possession,
there is no hazard in stating that they constitute all, of which we have
any positive knowledge. As they stand, they are a sufficient rebuke to the mendacity
of sensational itemizers of the public press; they will find in those records,
no basis on which to indite column articles of such doleful prophecies as the
public of late have been surfeited with.</p>

<p>During a period of thirty-nine years the records of the country exhibit the
fact, that there were but twenty-three days on which earthquakes occurred and
were deemed worthy of record. If we compare these figures with those recorded
from 1850 to the close of 1863, we shall find much more ground for prophecy
during the latter period than for the eighty-two years of which records were
kept on this coast previous to that time.</p>

<p>From the above extracts from the archives we are left to infer one of two facts;
either that earthquakes were entirely unknown during the intervals of the record
dates, or that they were of so trivial a character as not to merit the notice of
the early padres during this time; the latter is the probability, for we can
scarcely conceive that nothing of this nature had taken place. If, however,
such be the fact, it cannot be looked upon in any other light than a manifest
anomaly in the history of this or any other country.</p>

<p>It appears from all the testimony on the subject, that in May, 1812, the south
part of the State was frequently agitated with shocks of greater or less severity,
and their continuance was literally incessant for about four and one-half months.
Their frequency was not less than one each day or two; four days seldom
elapsing without a shock. As many as thirty shocks occurred in a single day
on more than one occasion. So frequent were they, that the inhabitants abandoned
their houses for the greater part of this period, and lived under trees,
etc., and slept out of doors at Santa Barbara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>This period of time seems analogous in some respects to the year 1852, and
was one of very marked severity on this coast, as was also the latter year; it
was analogous to other periods of subterranean disturbance in other parts of the
earth since the historic era began, and there is no good reason why we may not
look for the recurrence of similar events in future time. But we must not lay
too much stress on the destruction of the two mission churches in 1812, to
guide us in an estimate of the force of this earthquake, for the construction of
those buildings had but little relation to similar structures of modern date,
either in strength or material.</p>

<p>From 1812 to 1850, the archives are silent on this subject. In the latter year
our record began and has continued with little interruption to 1863, a period of
thirteen years. Within that period there are but few earthquakes occurring
north of the thirty-ninth parallel which have escaped notice and have not
been made matter of record.</p>

<h4>1850.</h4>

<p>During this year the following earthquakes were recorded:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>March 12th.—A light shock was felt in San José.</p>

<p>May 13th.—A light shock in San Francisco. An eruption of Mauna Loa, S.
I., and shock same day.</p>

<p>June 28th.—A light shock in San Francisco.</p>

<p>August 4th.—A smart shock was felt in Stockton and Sacramento.</p>

<p>September 14th.—Smart shock at San Francisco and San José. Total number
recorded in 1850, five.</p>

</div>

<h4>1851.</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p>May 15th.—Three severe shocks in San Francisco. During this earthquake
windows were broken and buildings severely shaken. A large amount of
merchandize was thrown down in a store on California Street. The shipping
in the harbor rolled heavily. An eruption of Mauna Loa and shock in the
Sandwich Islands same day.</p>

<p>May 17th.—A light shock in San Francisco.</p>

<p>May 28th.—A light shock on the Salinas.</p>

<p>June 13th.—A smart shock at San Francisco. This was felt at San Luis
Obispo and San Fernando.</p>

<p>December 2d.—A shock at Downieville.</p>

<p>December 31st.—A smart shock at Downieville. Total recorded in 1851, six.</p>

</div>

<h4>1852.</h4>

<p>From the beginning of this year until the middle of its last quarter, no disturbances
of the coast was noted until the month of November. In this month
the southern portion of the State was violently disturbed.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>November 26th.—The number of shocks on this day at San Simeon was eleven,
and at Los Angeles and San Gabriel the same number. Nearly or quite the
same number was also observed by parties having in charge a Government
train in transit from Fort Yuma to San Diego.</p>

</div>

<p>This earthquake or the series was experienced over the entire country, east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and south of Luis Obispo to San Diego and the Colorado River, covering a
line of country about three hundred miles in extent.</p>

<p>From subsequent accounts we learn that it also reached as far as Guaymas, in
the province of Sonora, Mexico.</p>

<p>For a period of six days subsequent to the twenty-sixth of November, the
whole of this region to the Colorado, was convulsed, with slight intermissions.
During this time a <i>mud volcano</i> opened on the Colorado Desert, and another
south of the river; one of these was visited by a portion of the United States
command under Col. Hientzelman.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>December 17th.—Two smart shocks at San Luis Obispo, which fractured the
walls of two adobe buildings, and threw down a part of the wall of a house
belonging to, and occupied by Don Jesus Pico and family.</p>

</div>

<p>During the months of November and December, the southern particularly,
and middle portions of California were much disturbed; shocks were experienced
in those sections for sixty-five days, with variable intermissions; they were
noticed as far north as the thirty-seventh parallel, but generally light in their
nature. The latest date of this series was to the fifth of January, 1853, on
the valley of the San Joaquin.</p>

<p>The period of time inclusive between the sixteenth of November (the date of
the terrible earthquake at Banda Neira in the Moluccas), and the twenty-sixth
of January, 1853, must be regarded as one of the most remarkable and portentious
periods of the earth’s history during modern times. For in that period a
greater proportion of the earth’s surface was convulsed by subterranean forces
than has been known for many scores of years, in the same length of time.</p>

<p>The area most severely affected by these phenomena is included between the
parallels of forty degrees south latitude and thirty-seven degrees north latitude,
and extending from one hundred and twenty degrees east to the forty-fifth degree
west longitude, being nearly equal to three-fifths of the equatorial, and a little
more than one-half the polar circumference of the earth.</p>

<p>At this time the coast of eastern Asia, the Islands of the South Indian Ocean,
Singapore, the fated Moluccas, the east coast of China, the north, east, and south
coasts of Australia, the coast of California, Mexico (west coast,) South America,
with portions of the Atlantic coast of the United States south of the thirty-fourth
parallel, north latitude, shared in the general disturbance which prevailed
on our own shores during this time. With the twenty-sixth of January ceased
the vibrations on this coast at that time, but we have positive intelligence that
they continued much later on the east coast of China and Australia, in which
countries they did not cease until the month of February. With these facts
before us we cannot but believe the period included one of the most turbulent
in the earth’s career during modern times.</p>

<h4>1853.</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Jan. 2d.—A shock of earthquake was felt in Mariposa; this was observed in
San Francisco, Bodega, and at Shasta City.</p>

<p>May 23d.—A shock at Crescent City.</p>

<p>May 31st.—An earthquake at Santa Barbara at 5h. 10m. In this earthquake
there were three distinct waves. The first was accompanied by profound
rumbling; the second shock was preceded by a loud, rushing noise like the
approach of a strong wind. About four or five seconds elapsed between each
shock. The sea was much disturbed, and a heavy surf swell came in soon
after the second shock passed. This surf-wave rolled inland some thirty feet
beyond the old wreck at the embarcadero. I saw the effect of this wave in
July following. The inhabitants were much frightened and left their beds
for the open air. Very little damage was sustained.</p>

<p>Oct. 26th.—A smart shock at San Francisco, near midnight. It was felt at
Benicia. This shock was followed by a swell in the bay, as vessels at the
wharfs swayed heavily on their hawsers.</p>

</div>

<p>Total in 1854, 12.</p>

<h4>1855.</h4>

<p>The following is the record of earthquakes for this year, in the State of California,
with the date and hour of the day at which they were observed:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Jan. 13th, 18h. 30m.—A smart shock occurred at San Benito and San Miguel.
It was felt at San Luis Obispo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Jan. 24th, 22h.—A heavy shock of earthquake was felt at Downieville, which
lasted seven seconds.</p>

</div>

<p>This earthquake was quite severe at Gibsonville on the north, at Forrest
City, Minnesota, in Sierra County, and at Orleans Flat, Eureka, in Nevada
County, at Georgetown and Nashville in El Dorado County on the south, and
at Keystone Ranch, in Yuba County, on the west. The entire distance north
and south affected was ninety-four miles, and in a westerly line, thirty miles.
The shock was preceded by a deep rumbling, and the rushing sound of wind in
the distance. It shook buildings severely. A large pinnacle of rocks on the
summit of the Downieville Buttes was thrown down, and some of the large fragments
reached the south branch of the North Yuba, at the base of the mountain.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Feb 5th, 22h.—A light shock was felt at Wolf Creek and the north-east part
of Nevada County.</p>

<p>April 7th, 18h.—A light shock was felt at Gibb’s Ferry, Trinity County,
and was experienced as far north as Callahan’s Ranch, at the head of Scott’s
Valley, Siskiyou County.</p>

<p>June 25th, 14h.—A smart shock was felt at Santa Barbara, and extended
northward as far as the valley of Santa Maria. This shock was cotemporaneous
with one that occurred in Switzerland.</p>

<p>July 10th, 9h. 30m.—A light shock was felt in Georgetown, El Dorado County,
which lasted about four seconds.</p>

<p>July 10th, 20h. 15m.—A severe shock at Los Angeles, which did considerable
damage.</p>

</div>

<p>There were four distinct shocks during the earthquake, with a period of about
two or three seconds elapsing between each vibration. During their continuance
the ground opened in several places, in fissures of one or two inches, the
marks of which remained for several days afterwards. There were some twenty-six
buildings in the city more or less injured, which I personally examined, and
among them the church, the west wall of which was split from top to bottom in
two places, the fissures being from one to two and a half inches in breadth, running
entirely through. The east wall split at a slight angle from the perpendicular,
and had but one fissure. The walls of the Star Hotel were split in
several places, and on the west side there appears to have been a decided horizontal
motion, as the wall was displaced on that side horizontally to the depth
of about one inch, and some eight or nine feet in length. The amount of
displacement decreased from the west end of the building towards the center.
It is a fact worthy of note, that none of the <i>thin</i> adobe walls of the buildings
suffered injury, while most of the <i>thick</i>-walled buildings were injured to a greater
or less extent.</p>

<p>During the earthquake, many articles were thrown down; those that were
standing on shelves against the east end of the buildings were thrown westward
on to the floor, and those on the opposite end of the buildings were thrown
back in an inclined position against the walls. These features were noticed in
the drug stores of Doctors Winston and Hope, situated on the main street, and
a short distance west of the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The meteorological condition of the atmosphere was rather unusual, and is
described as follows: The day was unusually warm and sultry, attended with a
little rain, (the latter very unusual) and a sudden change of temperature to
unpleasant coldness. At Point San Juan there was observed considerable commotion
in the water, attended with a strong rushing sound, and two unusually
heavy surf swells, immediately <i>following the last shock</i>.</p>

<p>This shock was felt distinctly at the saw-mill, some eight miles east of San
Bernardino, about seventy miles east of Los Angeles, and at Santa Barbara,
about one hundred miles in a westerly direction.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>Aug 12th, 9h. 30m.—A light shock of an earthquake was felt at Georgetown,
which lasted about three seconds. The vibration apparently came from the
north. Between this date and the tenth July there were four other light
shocks, the dates of which are not recorded.</p>

<p>Oct. 21st, 19h. 45m.—A smart shock of an earthquake was felt in San Francisco.
The buildings situated over the water were violently shaken. There
was much commotion in the water of the harbor a few minutes preceding the
shock, which caused several vessels to heave heavily at their hawsers and
cables.</p>

<p>Oct 27th, 15h.—A light shock was felt in the valley of Clear Lake. On the
same day a shock was felt at Downieville, which lasted about five seconds.
At Goodyear’s Bar it was more severe than at the preceding locality.</p>

<p>Dec. 5th, 11h. 20m.—The shock of an earthquake was felt at Humboldt Bay,
which lasted about three seconds. There were two vibrations, the last being
the most severe.</p>

<p>Dec. 11th, 4h.—A shock was felt in San Francisco and at the Mission Dolores;
at the latter place it is represented as being quite severe.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole number of which I have a record for 1855, amounts to twelve
only; but there may be others which have escaped my notice on account of
absence from the city.</p>

<p>The following table will show the number of shocks for each year, and each
month of the year, for six years from 1850 to 1855, inclusive.</p>

<p>From the above it will be seen that of the total number of shocks in six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
years in this State, forty-eight have occurred during the spring, summer, and
autumn months, and eleven during the winter months.</p>

<p>Of the total number noted, twenty-seven have occurred from San Luis Obispo
south, and of the thirty-two remaining, nine have been felt in San Francisco at
the same time they were observed at San Luis Obispo, while the remaining
twenty-three were felt at San Francisco and north of that point.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding we have had, what may, perhaps, be considered a frequency
in the recurrence of these phenomena, still there are but a <i>very few</i> of the total
number that would merit a moment’s consideration south of the twenty-fifth
parallel of north latitude, for there they would be regarded as minor affairs
entirely.</p>

<p>From all the facts in our possession relating to the phenomena on our coast,
it appears that the greatest preponderance in action and severity of effects, is
exerted, for the most part, south of Point Conception, for, from this place, east,
south and north, to near the Colorado, the most conclusive evidence exists of
very recent volcanic action having been exerted on rather an extensive scale,
and is also still persistent in several localities within the area named, though in
a minor degree.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to examine the changes of level that have evidently
taken place in this State within the last five years; but as more extended
observations would greatly assist us in forming conclusions on this subject, I
will defer that portion until a future day.</p>

<h4>1856.</h4>

<p>At the close of 1855, I presented to the Academy a statement of the occurrence
of earthquakes in this State for that year and a term of years preceding.</p>

<p>During the year just passed, I have kept a careful record of these phenomena,
which have been noticed in this city, and other parts of the State, and which will
be found below, with their date, and the hour of the day on which they took
place; they comprise all that have occurred, with perhaps two exceptions, the
dates for which were so obscure as to render it impossible to determine with accuracy
the precise period of their occurrence. So far as I am informed, those
shocks that have taken place in this State during the past year have not been
marked with more severity than has been usual in years preceding, frequently
amounting to a slight tremor, and at other times to more distinct movements;
three only have possessed sufficient intensity as to command general attention
during the busy hours of day.</p>

<p>Very few have been noticed by persons who were standing upon the earth at
the period of their occurrence. By far the greater proportion were observed in
high situations from the ground, and in the more retired parts of the city, or on
the alluvial covering of the country to the west and south.</p>

<p>The total number for the past year is sixteen, and of this number thirteen
were observed between sunset and sunrise.</p>

<p>By reference to the statistics below, it will be seen that even mountain districts,
where during the day there is much less of turmoil and noise arising from business
than in the populous city, that of all those noticed, none have been of sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
intensity to attract the attention of the inhabitants during the hours of
daylight. These facts, though few in themselves, are of importance, to disabuse
the public mind in relation to the danger to be apprehended from the occurrence
of these phenomena. The character which we sustain both at home and abroad,
as being in constant danger of being swallowed up by these occurrences, and
that our country is but a bed of latent volcanoes ready to burst forth at any
moment, spreading devastation over the land, is one of the greatest fallacies that
ever obtained possession of the human brain. Our State is as primitive as
Massachusetts or New Hampshire, and the dangers that surround us from the
sources above mentioned, are equally great as in the States just named.</p>

<p>We should remember that when speaking of California as a State, that we
include a line of territory equaling that of the seaboard lying between Cape
Hatteras on the south and the British Possessions on the north, and including
eleven of the seaboard States of the Union; and when we place our comparative
estimates on this basis in matters of this character, it will become at once
evident that the danger of annihilation from the causes under consideration, are
not of that magnitude which at first sight would appear.</p>

<p>Along the coast of Mexico and Central America, to the south of California
from all the records that are obtainable here there appears to have been a much
greater exemption from those phenomena than has been usual in former years;
this seems to have been the fact, also, throughout the Pacific, Oceanic, and most
of the Continental Islands along the coast of China, while to the north and
north-west, beyond the fifty-fifth parallel, both volcanic and earthquake phenomena
appear to have been greater than usual. This has been observable, for
the most part, in the neighborhood of the Aleutian Archipelago, along the
north-east coast of Japan, and in the British and Russian Possessions of North
America on the Pacific, and islands of the Ochotsk Sea.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know more of the predominance of these phenomena
in those regions, and such information could be easily obtained from the
commanders of the whaling fleet, if the proper measures were adopted to
secure it.</p>

<p>Below will be found some interesting matter upon this subject, which took
place during the past year near the Straits of Ourinach.</p>

<p>The earthquakes which have occurred in this State during 1856, and the
period of their occurrence, is as follows:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>January 2d, 10h. 15m.—This morning, a smart shock of an earthquake was
felt in San Francisco. The motion of the earth was undulatory, and came
apparently from the northward. A pendulum indicated a motion of about
five and a half inches.</p>

<p>January 21st, 16h.—Quite a smart shock occurred; it was quite sharp in the
south-west part of the city.</p>

<p>January 28th, 3h.—At the town of Petaluma, Sonoma County, a shock of an
earthquake occurred. It was sufficiently heavy to awake persons from their
sleep.</p>

<p>January 29th, 0h. 45m.—A slight shock was felt in San Francisco. It was
observed also at the Mission Dolores. There were three distinct tremors, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
short intervals elapsing between. The motion was apparently from the westward.</p>

<p>February 15th, 5h. 25m.—A severe shock of an earthquake was felt in San
Francisco, the duration of which was about eight seconds. Persons sleeping
were aroused, and many persons left their beds and sought the street. There
were two distinct shocks, the second very light and scarcely perceptible. The
motion was <i>undulatory</i> and <i>vertical</i>, and at the end of the first shock a very
strong, profound jar, with which it ceased.</p>

</div>

<p>The upper part of a building on Battery Street, for seventy feet in length,
was thrown down, the whole of which was above the cornice, very thin, and the
mortar with which it was constructed had not become hardened, being easily
removed by the fingers—it more resembled wet sand than a firm mortar.</p>

<p>There appears to have been but little difference in the sensation of persons
situated either in upper or basement stories.</p>

<p>It was preceded by a deep, heavy rumbling, and the motion apparently came
from the north-west. A distinct shock was felt at eight minutes past two o’clock
the same morning, by persons who were awake and up at the time.</p>

<p>The rotatory movement was shown in the fact that small square bottles and
boxes that stood upon a line, were moved from their position horizontally, describing
an arc of thirty degrees and upwards, as shown by the dust upon the
shelves on which they stood.</p>

<p>The first wave came with a force sufficient to project small articles three or
four feet on the floor, from shelves on which they were placed; they were apparently
all thrown in the same direction. Several clocks were stopped at precisely
5 hours 25 minutes.</p>

<p>All the cracks in walls and ceilings had a direction nearly north-west and
south-east, and most of them had the appearance of having been produced at
the moment of elevation.</p>

<p>The earthquake was felt heavily at Monterey, at five hours twenty minutes;
it was also felt at Bodega, but no time is given.</p>

<p>The vessels on the coast, and ranging from San Pedro on the south to Southern
Oregon, and at distances varying from eight to one hundred miles from land,
did not experience any shock. They were twenty-two in number.</p>

<p>Up to the present date the most northern point of which we have any record
of its having been felt, is at Santa Rosa, which is fifty-three miles north of San
Francisco, and at Monterey, ninety miles south of the latter place; to the east
of this city we have no record beyond Stockton. This would give for its length
one hundred and forty-three miles, and its breadth sixty-six miles.</p>

<p>Inquiry was made through the State line Telegraph at El Dorado, Nevada,
Downieville, Placerville, Marysville, Sacramento, Stockton, and San José; it
was not felt in any of the localities named, excepting the two last, and at Stockton
it was quite light.</p>

<p>If the time as given at Monterey was the same as at this city (San Francisco),
the velocity of the earth-wave must have been much slower than that of
the great earthquake at Simoda.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>March 24th, 22h. 20m.—A slight shock was felt at Canal Gulch, Siskiyou
County, also at Yreka. The motion is described as being horizontal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>March 31st, 13h. 25m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco. It consisted
of three light but distinct tremors.</p>

<p>April 6th, 23h. 30m.—A smart shock was felt at Los Angeles and the Monte,
people were aroused from their beds.</p>

<p>May 10th, 21h. 10m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco. The shock
was accompanied by a loud report, like the discharge of a cannon; people
mistook it for the signal gun of the mail steamer. This was felt at Monterey,
and in Contra Costa County.</p>

<p>May 2d, 0h. 10m.—A severe shock was felt at Los Angeles. It caused much
trembling among the buildings, and considerable alarm among the people,
many leaving their beds. The shock was preceded by two loud reports like
the blasting of rock; it apparently came from the north-west; no damage was
done.</p>

<p>August 2d, 5h. 20m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco. It was sufficiently
strong to awaken persons in bed; it was evidently more severe in
Stockton.</p>

<p>August 27th, 21h. 15m.—An earthquake was felt at Mission San Juan, Monterey
County. There were two distinct shocks with short intervals elapsing,
the second being the heaviest. The motion is described as undulatory and
coming from the west. It was felt at Monterey and at Santa Cruz.</p>

<p>September 6th, 3h.—A smart shock felt at Santa Cruz. It created considerable
consternation and many persons left their beds.</p>

<p>September 20th, 23h. 30m.—A very severe shock was felt in different parts of San
Diego County, and at that town. At Santa Isabel the ceilings of the dwellings
were shaken down; the cattle stampeded and ran bellowing in all directions,
and the Indians seemed equally terrified. The walls of the adobe buildings
were many of them cracked. The motion is described as oscillatory. A
light shock occurred on the following Monday morning.</p>

<p>November 12th, 4h.—A smart shock occurred at Humboldt Bay. Another
shock was reported but no date given.</p>

</div>

<p>From the record before us it will be seen that of fifteen, the total number
of earthquakes recorded during 1856, seven have been felt in San Francisco in
common with other parts of the State; seven have occurred south of this locality
that were not observed here, and four north of it. Of the seven shocks
noticed here five only were not observed in any adjacent district, and may be
considered as strictly local. The periods of the year at which the shocks have
occurred, are as follows: During the winter months, five; during the autumn,
three; during the spring and summer, six. None have taken place between the
vernal and autumnal equinoxes.</p>

<p>We have records of considerable and violent volcanic phenomena throughout
the northern seas, and islands both to the east and west of Alaska. The Russian
frigate <i>Dwina</i>, while lying at Shuam Shu, brings intelligence of the outburst
of a volcano in that vicinity about the twenty-second of June, and on
the twenty-fifth of the same month passed through fields of floating pumice;
the latitude by observation being fifty degrees fifty-three minutes, and longitude
one hundred and fifty-eight degrees thirty-two minutes east, per chronometer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting account of a submarine volcano was reported by the Captain
of the bark <i>Alice Frazer</i>, in latitude fifty-four degrees thirty-six minutes, longitude
one hundred and thirty-five degrees west, which is as follows: A portion of
the whaling fleet, four in number, were running through the Straits of Ourinack,
on the twenty-sixth of July last; while passing the straits a submarine volcano
burst out, sending a column of water several hundred feet upward; immediately
following this, immense masses of lava were projected into the air, and the sea
for miles and for days afterward, was covered with floating fragments of pumice.
The ships <i>Scotland</i> and <i>Enterprise</i> were nearer the volcano than the ships
<i>Frazer</i> and <i>Wm. Thomson</i>; on the decks of the two former considerable
pumice, lava, and ashes fell. There were seven vessels in the straits at the time
of the occurrence, three of which names I could not learn.</p>

<p>The outburst was accompanied with violent shocks of earthquake. It is the
opinion of Captain Newell, of the <i>Alice Frazer</i>, that considerable shoaling has
been the result of this submarine action.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">On the Direction and Velocity of the Earthquake in California, January
9, 1857—By Dr. John B. Trask.</span></h4>

<p>The earthquake which occurred in various parts of this State, on the morning
of the ninth January last excited at the time considerable attention. This
arose from two causes. First, from the varied reports that appeared on the following
day through the press of the city, detailing its occurrence in remote
mountain towns, and for which there was no foundation. Secondly, from the
great extent over which the commotion was felt, as was subsequently proved.</p>

<p>Immediately following the occurrence of the phenomenon, letters were addressed
to all the principal towns between Mariposa and Downieville, east of the
valleys, for the purpose of learning how far the shocks may have extended eastward
of this city. These letters were forwarded by the Pacific Express Company
to their agents, and through them answers were returned in every case but
two through the same source. From the facts thus obtained, it was found that
in no locality east of the foothills, <i>was any shock felt on that day or night</i>.</p>

<p>Another report, equally unfounded, reached us on the arrival of the steamer
from the southern coast, to the effect that several houses had been demolished
in San Diego from its violence, while the facts in the case are <i>that the steamer
left that port twenty-four hours before the shock occurred there</i>.</p>

<p>This earthquake, or more properly speaking the series of shocks that began
on the night of the eighth in this city, and which continued in the south part of
the State during the following day and night of the ninth, was probably the
most extensive of any on record on this portion of the Pacific coast, excepting,
perhaps, that of the wave of the Simoda earthquake in December, 1854. The
linear distance over which we are able to trace its course, amounts to six hundred
and two miles, and its breadth, so far as now ascertained, is two hundred
and ninety miles. It has all the appearance of having been the terminal movement
of some more violent commotion at a distance from our coast.</p>

<p>From the best evidence obtainable at present, it seems to have had its origin
to the west and traveled in an easterly direction. This is conclusively proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from the fact that it was felt earlier at San Francisco than at any other locality
east of this city within the State. We have no record as yet of its occurrence
along the coast of Mexico or of Oregon.</p>

<p>I have been able to determine with considerable accuracy the period of time
at which the shock between eight and nine o’clock on the morning of the ninth
took place, at four localities east of the City of San Francisco, in this State; as
the shock at that hour seems to have been more generally noticed than those
which either preceded or followed it here or elsewhere, though at this city it was
much less marked than the shocks at 1h. 33m., 4h. 15m., and 7h., these three
latter occurring at those hours of the morning when most persons are sleeping.
The shock at 7h., produced a circular motion in the pendulum, the diameter of
which was about five inches. The oscillations of the pendulum in all the others
were in an easterly and westerly direction.</p>

<p>The precise period of time at which the shock took place at San Francisco,
between eight and nine o’clock, is determined by the stopping of a time-piece
belonging to J. W. Tucker, whose rate of error was three seconds fast. The
time at San Diego was furnished by Mr. Cassidy, of the army, and that of the
Tejon Reserve is by persons at that post. To private gentlemen at Sacramento
and Stockton we are indebted for the time at those places. The accompanying
table of latitudes and longitudes of localities named, gives the hour at which the
shock took place at each; the difference or elapsed time, from which the velocity
was deduced, are the mean times corrected for the places named, the time as
given above being taken as the standard at San Francisco.</p>

<p>It is proper to state that three minutes four seconds, was the greatest error in
time found, and the least was twenty-two seconds:</p>

<p>The velocity is given in miles per minute, and by dividing the sum of the
same by their number, it will be found that the movement of the wave at that
time averages a fraction over 6.2 miles per minute.</p>

<p>The results obtained from the above data approximate closely the deductions
of Prof. Bache on the wave which reached our shores and resulting from the
earthquake at Simoda on the twenty-third December, 1854, and which will be
found in a paper read by that gentleman at the meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, during the early part of last year.</p>

<p>From the facts before us, there can be but little doubt of the direction of the
commotion, and that it proceeded from the west, or a little south of that point.
The motion of the earth, as described at the different localities at which it was
felt, with the motion of the pendulum—which was slightly south of a west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
line—leads to that conclusion. Time is an important element in aiding us to
form correct conclusions regarding these phenomena, and it is to be hoped that
our friends in different parts of the State, in reporting the same, will be precise
in this particular. Of the incidents attending the shocks, many and varied
reports have reached us; it seems to have acted with greater violence in the
vicinity of the Tejon Reserve and upper Tulare County than at any other place.
It is most remarkable that so small an amount of intensity of force was manifested
when the area over which it extended is taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The effects were felt in San Francisco several hours before they are reported
to have been observed at any other place north or south. They began here at
twenty minutes past eleven, on the night of the eighth, and continued till thirteen
minutes past eight the following morning—six shocks occurring in the interval;
while to the south, the first shock noticed at the Tejon, was at six hours
thirty minutes, on the ninth. In Los Angeles they continued at long intervals
through the day until twenty-three hours thirty minutes of the same
date. I have learned from persons who were present in Los Angeles at this
time, and also at the shock of the fourteenth July, 1855, that the severity of the
latter exceeded that of the ninth January last past.</p>

<h4>1857.</h4>

<p>During the past year there has been rather a frequency in the occurrence of
the phenomena of earthquakes; and, with the exception of two, there have been
none that were particularly remarkable either for extent of surface affected or
severity of action. In one, that of the ninth of January, the greatest extent of
surface, and greatest intensity of action was manifest. Its principal force seems
to have been expended in the more southerly portions of our State, and in the
immediate vicinity of those volcanic (?) vents found at different localities upon the
Colorado Desert. It is manifest, however, that this shock and those which preceded
it on the night of the eighth, had their origin to the west of our coast, as
the times of occurrence of the shock at different localities most fully prove.
This matter was fully discussed in my previous paper, “On the direction and
velocity of the earthquake of January 9th, 1857,” read before this Society
March 30th, which will be found in their proceedings.</p>

<p>The other shock of greatest extent, on the second of September, extended
over an area of about two hundred miles, but was marked by no particular
severity or injury, except that of fright to those who experienced it.</p>

<p>The whole number that can be authenticated as occurring during 1857,
amounts to seventeen, being greater than the number recorded in 1853 and
1856; and it would seem probable from our records that this number is the
maximum to which we shall probably be subjected in this State.</p>

<p>From the Sandwich Islands we have no news of earthquakes save one, which
is here inserted: “A very severe shock of earthquake was felt at Kawaihae,
Hawaii, on the twenty-fourth of February, the most severe that the residents
there have had for many years.”</p>

<p>The arrival of the whaling fleet from the Northern seas brings no intelligence
of the occurrence of these phenomena, as was the case of the preceding year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
hence, the presumption is, that subterranean action has not been violent in those
distant regions during the year just passed.</p>

<p>On the coast of Mexico, and inclusive between the twenty-fifth and thirty-second
parallels, we have received intelligence of the occurrence of one earthquake,
which appears to have been felt on both shores of the Gulf of California
for a distance of nearly two hundred miles, both north and south. We have no
records south of that point.</p>

<p>The shocks which we can authenticate within the limits of our own State,
are as follows:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>January 9th.—This shock was felt from Sacramento to the southern boundary
of the State. It was preceded by three smart shocks the night and morning
previous. At Santa Barbara water was thrown over the surface from a shoal
well, seven feet deep, the water in which was less than three feet in depth.</p>

<p>January 18th, 9h.—A light shock at Martinez and Benicia.</p>

<p>January 20th, 8h. 30m.—A smart shock was felt at Santa Cruz and Mission
San Juan.</p>

<p>January 21st, 23h.—On the evening of this day a smart shock was felt at Mariposa.
The wave and sound seemed to travel from north-west to south-east.
It was accompanied with a report like that of a distant gun.</p>

<p>February 5th, 7h.—A smart shock was felt in San Francisco, which shook the
buildings that are situated on made-ground very severely, while those situated
on firmer bottoms were affected. This shock was felt at Oakland and
Stockton, but was not felt at San José or Sacramento, as reported at the
time.</p>

<p>March 14th, 15h.—A severe shock was felt at Santa Barbara and Montecito.
It was momentary in duration, attended with a loud report.</p>

<p>March 23d, 12h. 27m.—A light shock in San Francisco.</p>

<p>May 3d, 22h.—A smart shock at Los Angeles and the Monte.</p>

<p>May 23d.—A light shock at Los Angeles; a report also that a severe shock
had been felt at Fort Tejon.</p>

<p>June 14th.—A shock was felt at Humboldt Bay. On the same day several
severe shocks were experienced at the Penal Island (Carmen), Gulf of California,
and which extended almost ninety miles north and south of the island.</p>

<p>August 8th, 11h.—A smart shock was felt at Rabbit Creek, Sierra County.</p>

<p>August 29.—A severe shock at the Tejon Reserve. No time is given.</p>

<p>September 2d, 19h. 45m.—A light shock at San Francisco. This shock was
felt at Sacramento, Marysville, Nevada, San Juan, Downieville, and Camptonville.</p>

<p>September 14th, 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>—A light shock in San Francisco.</p>

<p>October 19th, 18h. 30m.—A severe shock of an earthquake in San Francisco.</p>

<p>October 20th, 12h. 8m., 12h. 35m., and 13h. 15m.—Three other shocks occurred;
the last was equally severe with that of January 9th, at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> People were
much frightened, and left their beds. The shock was felt at San José, but
not at Oakland.</p>

<p>November 8th, 8h. 45m.—A shock at San Francisco, which was felt at Oakland
and Bodega.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
December 23d, 7h.—A light shock at San Francisco.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the whole number which have occurred during the year, two only have
been felt at San Francisco that were not experienced at other localities, and
four others have occurred which have been felt in common at other portions of
the State—thus making about one-third of the whole number that were in common
here and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Eight of the aggregate have occurred between the summer and winter solstices.</p>

<p>Seven have occurred during the spring and summer months, and ten during
the winter and autumn.</p>

<p>Eight have occurred between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.</p>

<h4>1858.</h4>

<p>During the past year we have had occasion to note the occurrence of eight
shocks of earthquake in this State. This number is one-half less than that in
1857, and one-third less the number in 1856. The shocks, with one exception,
have been unmarked by anything like violence, being little else than mere vibrations
or tremors, not noticeable by the great majority of the people. They are
as follows:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>February 10th.—A smart shock at Kanaka Flat, Sierra County. No time
noted.</p>

<p>February 15th, 4h. 20m.—A light shock in San Francisco. Was observed in
the County of San Mateo ten miles south of the city.</p>

<p>August 19th, 22h. 10m.—A light shock in San Francisco. The motion was
east to west, and was undulatory.</p>

<p>September 2d.—A smart shock at Santa Barbara, no time given.</p>

<p>September 3d, 0h. 40m.—A smart shock in San José. This shock was felt at
Santa Cruz, twenty-five miles west, and was evidently more marked in strength
at that locality. No damage.</p>

<p>September 12th, 19h. 40m.—A smart shock at San Francisco. The motion
was from north to south. There were two vibrations with undulatory movements
lasting about fifteen seconds.</p>

<p>September 26th, 1h. 26m.—A light shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>November 26th, 0h. 24m.—A heavy shock at San Francisco. This shock was
by far the heaviest during the year, it awoke most people from slumber and
created no little alarm; persons left their beds and sought cooler situations
with less attire than is usually worn. The iron pillars in the second story of
the custom house have separated from the ceiling above about half an inch,
and are supposed to have settled from the effects of the shock; I much doubt
the alleged cause of this displacement, as the pillars below present no indication
of similar disturbance. This shock was felt at Oakland ten miles east of
the city, but was not felt at Stockton, Sacramento, nor Marysville. It was
evidently confined to an area of ten or twelve miles.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h4>1859.</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p>January 25th, 20h. 20m.—A heavy shock of earthquake was felt in Trinity
and Shasta counties. It was felt at Weaverville, Shasta, and Horsetown.</p>

<p>April 4th, 13h.—Quite a severe shock was felt at San José. There were several
vibrations, apparently from north to south.</p>

<p>August 10th, 22h. 35m.—A smart shock was felt in this city (San Francisco).</p>

<p>September 26th, 6h. 10m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>October 5th, 13h. 18m.—A very smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>November 27th, 19h. 15m.—A light shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>December 1st, 0h. 50m.—A smart shock at San Francisco. Felt at Oakland
and Benicia.</p>

<p>December 1st, 14h. 10m.—Several successive shocks were felt at San Bernardino;
several of them were quite heavy, causing much alarm. No damage
was done.</p>

</div>

<p>Whole number of shocks during this year was eight.</p>

<h4>1860.</h4>

<p>During the year last past this portion of the Pacific coast has been but
little disturbed by earthquakes. There have been but three during this period
that can be well authenticated, and one, viz.: December 21st, whose character
is somewhat doubtful.</p>

<p>The shocks that have occurred are as follows:</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>March 27th.—A severe shock was experienced at Los Angeles and vicinity,
which was not productive of any damage to person or property. No time is
given in the account.</p>

<p>March 15th, 11h.—A violent shock was experienced at Sacramento; the wave
passed through the counties of Placer, Nevada, El Dorado and Plumas. At
Iowa Hill the church bells were rung, also at Sacramento. At the latter
place and at Forest City, clocks, in many of the buildings, were stopped.
This earthquake extended to the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada. At
Carson City it occurred at 10h. 45m. and very violent; goods were shaken
off the shelves in many of the stores, and a general panic and stampede prevailed.</p>

<p>November 12th.—A smart shock was felt at Humboldt Bay and its vicinity,
but no damage was done.</p>

<p>December 21st, 6h. 30m.—At San Francisco a series of light vibrations of the
earth occurred, which continued with but two remissions for the space of half
an hour. These vibrations were not perceptible to persons in the building
otherwise than by mercurial column, which was equal to seven inches of the
barometer, and was the mercury gauge of an air pump that had remained
stationary at twenty-four inches for the space of four hours. At this time
the column in the gauge began to show much disturbance by oscillating up
and down in a very rapid manner without any apparent cause; the stop
screws (Faraday’s) were all tried at the moment and found perfectly tight
as they had remained for hours previous.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The oscillations were watched carefully by Mr. J. Roach and myself for half
an hour, at which time they ceased. The maximum of the mercury column was
a fraction over an inch, which was attained through vibrations of one-fourth to
one-eighth of an inch rapidly repeated and continuous, and as gradually, through
a series of lighter vibrations, the displacement would diminish and the column
subside to its former level; this was three times repeated, the column at no time
being at rest. The period of time occupied by the column in reaching its maximum
of disturbance each time was from eight to twelve minutes. There was
no apparent cause for this disturbance, unless it be attributable to a series of
light vibrations of the earth occurring in a vertical direction, and to that cause
I am disposed to assign it.</p>

<p>The passing of carriages on the street did not affect these vibrations of the
column, for they continued in the same manner when those vehicles were not
passing. While the oscillations were going on, I took a sledge and struck some
half a dozen blows on an anvil block in the workshop, which did not make any
perceptible difference in the movements of the column; after it had come to
rest, the same experiment was repeated, but the column did not in any manner
react to the concussion thus produced.</p>

<h4>1861.</h4>

<p>During 1861 there has been but one earthquake recorded in the State.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>July 4th, 16h. 11m.—A severe shock of earthquake occurred at San Francisco.
It consisted of three distinct waves following each other in very rapid succession.
Its effects to the east of the city in the San Ramon Valley were more
severe. Near the house of Mr. Larabie it opened a large fissure in the earth.
In the vicinity of Mr. Porter’s it opened a new spring of water, and a small
running stream was also caused near Mr. Hunt’s. For several days after,
light shocks were repeated at intervals.</p>

</div>

<h4>1862.</h4>

<div class="hanging">

<p>September 29th, 15h. 5m.—A very smart shock of earthquake at San Francisco.
This was felt at Petaluma.</p>

<p>December 23d, 20h. 19m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

</div>

<h4>1863.</h4>

<p>During the year 1863 we have had five earthquakes, and unmarked by any
serious event.</p>

<div class="hanging">

<p>January 25th, 2h. 20m.—A severe shock was experienced at San Diego, continuing
from five to eight seconds. There was no undulation in this instance,
the shock consisting of a series of sharp jars. It was preceded by a profound
rumbling sound.</p>

<p>February 1st, 16h. 1m.—A very smart shock at the Mission San Juan, Monterey
County. At Gilroys the shock was felt (or another) fifteen minutes
later. The latter town is near twelve miles east of the Mission. At both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
localities the motion was undulatory. The shock was not felt at Monterey,
twelve miles west of San Juan.</p>

<p>June.—A smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>July 15th, 10h. 19m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>August 1st, 11h. 6m.—Two light shocks at San Francisco about one hour
apart.</p>

<p>December 19th, 12h. 38m.—A very smart shock was felt throughout the city;
directly afterwards another and more severe one occurred. The first was a
sharp, sudden jar, the second undulatory. The accuracy of the telegraph
operator at Santa Clara enables us to form a correct idea of the course of this
wave. His time was 14h. 44m. 31s., and within twenty-nine seconds of true
time. The elapsed time is 7m. 31s., and gives for the direction of the seismic
wave a course north and south (in lieu of east and west in my first notice
which was thus in error.) I take this opportunity to express the thanks of
the Academy to this operator for his accuracy and kindness in furnishing us
dates in this and other phenomena of scientific and public interest.</p>

</div>

<p>The figures derived from our statistics furnish us the following interesting
results as to the frequency of shocks in one season of the year more than in
another. The tables below furnish the details.</p>

<p>It is found from these figures that during the thirteen years ending December,
1863:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The number of days on which earthquakes have occurred, is one hundred
and ten.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> The month in which the greatest number have occurred is January,
being sixteen; and the months in which the least number have occurred, is
April and February, the sum of each being six.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The winter months have given the largest number in the aggregate,
the sum being thirty-four. The summer months the smallest number; their sum
being twenty-three. The spring months have given twenty-four, and the autumn
months twenty-nine.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i> The number of shocks between the equinoxes foot up thus. Between
the autumnal and vernal equinoxes the sum is sixty-four; between the vernal
and autumnal equinoxes, the sum fifty-two.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i> The number of shocks that have taken place between the solstices
stand thus. From the winter to the summer solstice the sum is fifty-four. From
the summer to the winter solstice, the sum is fifty-nine.</p>

<p>I regret that my records of the occurrence of earthquakes upon the east
coast of the United States is not more complete than it is, and also that it does
not extend through an equivalent period of time as our own, from 1850 to date;
but I have no authentic records of their occurrence on the other side later than
1854; my business at that time, and the subsequent period that has elapsed,
being such that I was not able to maintain their continuation. In order to
prove the statement made on a preceding page correct as to our relative immunity
on this coast over equal extent of territory, I here subjoin the totals
on both coasts during that period of time. This statement will also include
those shocks which were matters of record belonging to the West India Islands,
and which properly belong to the eastern-coast series.</p>

<p>The figures relating to this matter, stands thus:</p>

<p>In California during 1850, five shocks; 1851, six shocks; 1852, two shocks;
1853, thirteen shocks; 1854, eleven shocks. Total, thirty-seven shocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>In United States, east coast. 1850, three shocks; 1851, seven shocks; 1852,
ten shocks; 1853, thirteen shocks; 1854, eleven shocks. Total, forty-four
shocks.</p>

<p>Balance against east coast, seven shocks.</p>

<p>West India Islands. 1852, seven shocks; 1853, three shocks; 1854, one
shock. Total, eleven shocks.</p>

<p>These inclusive with the continental series foot up eighteen days on which
shocks occurred in excess of this coast during the same period of time, and
thus shows a margin of greater frequency of little more than thirty per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. Brewer presented for Mr. Gabb the following paper:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>On Cretaceous Fossils from Sahuaripa Valley, State of Sonora,
Mexico, discovered by August Rémond</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. M. GABB.</p>

<p>Mr. Rémond announced in a letter to me, the discovery of fossiliferous rocks
about a league and a half east of Arivechi, Sahuaripa Valley, Sonora, Mexico.
The fossils occur in a clay slate, and are in a fine state of preservation. He
says: “The shales rest on sandstones, barren of fossils; feldspathic porphyries
protrude through them, but no alteration of the beds were observed at the points
of contact. Even the lamination of the fossiliferous strata has not been disturbed,
and shells are found but a few millimetres from the porphyry.” He adds
that the fossil bearing strata may attain a thickness of four or five hundred feet.
The shales are overlaid by thick strata of compact blueish limestone. The
strata dip to the south-east with an inclination of from thirty to fifty degrees,
and form the first range of foot-bills of the Sierra Madre.</p>

<p>I have identified the following species on a hasty examination, proving conclusively
the cretaceous age of the formation. It is an interesting fact, that
the fossils indicate a closer relationship to the eastern deposits than to those of
California.</p>

loose quartz crystals; but on drying it shrank greatly in bulk and
became fibrous, like fine Asbestos. The miners say that it is not
uncommon in that locality.</p>

<p>Seeds of a large Melon Cactus, from the Colorado deserts; also
seeds of a fine nutritious “bunch grass,” from the dry foot hills
near Fresno river, by Mr. J. E. Clayton.</p>

<p>Mr. Brewer stated that he had obtained further information
regarding the coal brought before the Academy Feb. 15th, by Prof.
Blake. On the authority of J. Ross Browne and another gentleman,
he had learned that no coal occurs in the locality near the
Colorado River then mentioned, and that the specimens were
English coal carried up the river by speculators for the purpose of
swindling the public by selling stock in a fictitious coal mine.</p>

<h3>Descriptions of New Marine Shells from the Coast of California.<br />
PART I.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PHILIP P. CARPENTER, B.A., PH.D.<br />
<i>Corresponding Member of the Académies of Philadelphia and California, etc.</i></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Warrington, England</span>, May 4th, 1864.</p>

<p>The shells to be described in these papers were collected by Dr. J. G. Cooper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
for the State Geological Survey of California. Being aware that I was engaged
in preparing descriptions of the shells of the Smithsonian collections, to
serve as a handbook on the Mollusca of the western coast, and also (at the
present time), a “Supplementary Report on the present state of our knowledge
of the Mollusca of the west coast of North America,” for the British Association;
he has very obligingly transmitted to me such duplicates as could be
spared from the State collection for identification.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Calliostoma Swainson</span>, 1840.</h4>

<h5><i>Calliostoma formosum</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 615 a.</h5>

<p>C. t. subelevatá, brunnescens, fusco-purpureo nebulosa, anfr. vii. valde tumentibus,
suturis impressis; carinis majoribus in spirâ duabus, gemmatis, interdum
brunneo huc et illuc tinctis; serie granulorum minorum prope suturam; serie
quartá minimorum inter duas carinas; lirulis basalibus circ. ix., fusco maculatis;
interstitiis à lineis incrementi corrugatis; aperturá subquadratá. Long. 0.47,
long. spir. 0.34, lat. 0.43, div. 68°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Pedro five; San Diego four dead on beach at low water—very
rare. It is well distinguished by the two principal necklaces, with smaller rows
intercalating. In coloring it resembles C. eximium Reeve, (versicolor Menke,
Mazatlan Catal.), from the Gulf of California.</p>

<h5><i>Calliostoma splendens</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 530 a.</h5>

<p>C. t. parvâ, latiore, tenuiore; exquisité rufo-castaneo et purpureo, interdum
intensioribus, et livido, varie nebulosâ et punctatâ; anfractu primo nucleoso
diaphano, granuloso, apice mamillato; dein iv. normalibus, subtabulatis; primo
costibus spiralibus ii. acutis, valde expressis, alterâ parvâ suturali; anfr. penult.
costis iii. quarum media extantior, superior subgranulosa; anfr. ult. aliis intercalantibus,
supra peripheriam v. quarum tertia magis extans; interstitiis à lineis
incrementi vix decussatis; costâ circa peripheriam angulatam conspicuâ; basi
costulis rotundatis, haud extantibus, peripheriam et axim versus conspicuis,
medio sæpe obsoletis; basi nitidâ, subplanatâ; aperturâ subquadratâ, intus
carneo-nacreâ, valde splendente: operculo tenuissimo, levissimo, pallido, diaphano,
concavo; anfr. circ. x. crebris, parum definitis.</p>

<p>Long. 0.23, long. spir. 0.15, lat. 0.24, div. 87°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Monterey, 20 fms. dredged 2, dead; Santa Barbara, in roots of kelp
growing in about 10 fms. 13, dredged in 16 fms. 2, dead; S. B. Island, 2, dead,
on beach; Catalina Island, 30-40 fms. 2, alive; San Diego, 1, dead.</p>

<p>The specimens here described are probably mature, and are well marked in
character. The painting is richly lustrous, of a fleshy nacre inside; outside, of
a rich orange-chestnut or red, variously laid on a light ground, sometimes with
streaks of nacreous purple, often with dots on the ribs. The operculum is
extremely thin and transparent.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Solariella</span> Searles Wood, 1843.</h4>

<h5><i>Solariella peramabilis</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 1025.</h5>

<p>S. t. tenuissimâ, elegantissime sculptâ, lividâ, rufo-fusco pallide maculatâ;
anfr. nucl. ii. valde tumidis, lævibus, apice mamillato; dein anfr. norm. iv. tabulatis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
suturis fere rectangulatis, supra spiram bi-seu tri-carinatis, carinulis aliis
postea intercalantibus; totâ superficie elegantissime et creberrime radiatim
lirulatâ, lirulis acutissimis, extantibus, supra carinas subgranulosis, interstitia
anfr. primis fenestrantibus, postea decussantibus; basi valde rotundatâ; carinulis
circ. v., anticâ granulosâ, sculptâ; umbilico maximo, anfractus intus
monstrante, lineis spiralibus circ. iii. distantibus, et lirulis radiantibus à basi
continuis, concinne ornato; aperturâ rotundatâ, à carinulis indentatâ, vix
parieti attingente, intus iridescente, nacreâ: operculo tenuissimo, multispirali,
anfr. circ. x., radiatim eleganter rugulosis.</p>

<p>Long. 0.38, long. spir. 0.19, lat. 0.42, div. 85°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island, 30-120 fms. 20, both alive and dead.</p>

<p>The name <i>Solariella</i>, given to a crag fossil (tertiary) species by Searles Wood,
which he afterwards reunited to <i>Margarita</i>, is here used as a subgenus, in the
author’s sense, for <i>Margaritæ</i> with large crenated umbilicus. This is one
of the many instances in which the North Pacific fauna carries out the ideas
of the English crag. Unfortunately, the name appears in Add. Gen. I, 431,
for a subgenus of <i>Monilea</i>, with which these shells have only a limited affinity;
and, accordingly, the true <i>Solariellæ</i> have been reconstituted as part of <i>Minolia</i>,
A. Ad. That gentleman, however, fully accords with the present arrangement.
The <i>Solariellæ</i> are known from <i>Trochiscus</i>, and from all forms of <i>Solariadæ</i>, by
the normal (not inverted) nuclear whirls; and from the Solarids, by the nacreous
texture.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper’s very lovely species of a very lovely group may possibly prove
to be a variety of the Japanese “<i>Minolia aspecta</i> A. Ad.” ms. in Mus. Cuming;
but, until more specimens from each district have been compared, it is more
prudent to keep them separate. It seems to have exhausted the powers of
sculpture on its graceful habitation. Under the microscope, the sharp transverse
lirulæ, mounting over the keels, dividing the interspaces, and even ascending
the wide umbilicus, are eminently beautiful. Even the operculum is sculptured
with delicate waved radiating lines. It has the aspect of an extremely
thin <i>Torinia</i>, with a funnel-shaped umbilicus. This is not only bounded by a
granular keel, but has three other distant spiral lines crossing the lirulæ. The
radiating sculpture is more distant on the upper whirls, where first two, then
three keels appear, fenestrated by the lirulæ, which afterwards become much
closer, and are sometimes worn away behind the labrum.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Margarita</span> Leach, 1819.</h4>

<h5><i>Margarita acuticostata</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 354.</h5>

<p>M. t. <i>M. lirulatæ</i> simili; parvâ, tenui, albido-cinereâ, olivaceo-fusco varie
maculatâ, seu punctulatâ; anfr. nucleosis ii. lævibus, tumidis, fuscis, apice
mamillato; anfr. norm. iii. tumidis, tabulatis, suturis rectangulatis; carinis
acutis in spirâ iii., quartâ peripheriali, æquidistantibus; interstitiis spiraliter
striatis; in spirâ et circâ basim radiatim creberrime striulatis; basi subrotundatà,
lirulis distantibus circ. ix. ornatâ; umbilico magno, infundibuliformi,
vix angulato, intus interdum striis spiralibus paucis sculpto; aperturâ subrotundatâ,
pariete parum attingente: operculo anfr. paucioribus, circ. vi. suturis
subelevatis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Long. 0.18, long. spir. 0.12, lat. 0.19, div. 87°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Santa Barbara, in kelp-root, 2, dead; Catalina Island, 8-10 fms. 20,
some alive; Monterey, 20 fms. 4, dead.</p>

<p>This shell might be taken for a delicate form of <i>Gibbula parcipicta</i>, which in
painting it exactly resembles. It is known from the Vancouver <i>M. lirulata</i> by
the three sharp keels on the spire, between which there are no others intercalating,
and by the details of sculpture. The patches of color are very variable,
sometimes scarcely appearing; and are generally deeper tinted on the keels,
giving a false appearance of granulation.</p>

<h5><i>Margarita salmonea</i> Carp. (? var.) State Collection, Species 352.</h5>

<p>M. t. inter <i>M. undulatæ</i> et <i>M. pupillæ</i> intermediâ; minore, spirâ satis elevatâ;
anfr. nucl. iii. purpureis; dein iv. normalibus, colore salmoneo; liris spiralibus
in spirâ viii., quarum ii. suturales, minimæ; suturis haud undulatis; interstitiis
à lineis incrementi creberrimis, haud elevatis, sculptis; basi lirulis creberrimis,
æqualibus, circ. xviii. ornatâ; aperturâ subquadratâ; umbilico minore, angulato:
operculo tenuissimo, diaphano, anfr. circ. x. vix definitis.</p>

<p>Long. 0.22, long. spir. 0.14, lat. 0.22, div. 80°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Monterey, 6-20 fms. 5, alive; Catalina Island, 30-40 fms. 2, alive.</p>

<p>This shell differs from the common <i>Margarita</i> of the Vancouver district
(<i>M. pupilla</i> Gld. = <i>calliostoma</i> A. Ad.), in its much deeper and salmon-tinted
hue; its finer sculpture, absence of decussation, and want of distant liræ round
the umbilicus. From the Norwegian specimens of <i>M. undulata</i> it is known
by the absence of sutural waves, and by the finer basal riblets, of which the
interstices are minutely sculptured across. The operculum differs from both, in
its great thinness and smoothness. Additional specimens may better display
its true relations.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Liotia Gray</span>, 1842.</h4>

<h5><i>Liotia fenestrata</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 1006.</h5>

<p>L. t. parvâ, primum subdiscoideâ, postea variante, albido-cinereâ; anfr. nucl.
lævibus, planatis, apice depresso; anfr. norm. ii. et dimidio, convexis; clathris
validis distantibus circ. xv. radiantibus, et vii. spiralibus, subæquantibus, conspicue
fenestratâ; aperturâ circulari, sæpius plus minusve declivi, parieti vix
attingente; umbilico maximo, anfractus monstrante; labio, regione umbilicari,
sinuato.</p>

<p>Long. 0.09, long. spir. 0.04, lat. 0.12, div. 170°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island; beach to 40 fms. 20, dead.</p>

<p>This strongly sculptured species varies greatly (in the two specimens sent to
the Smithsonian Institution), in the declivity of the mouth and consequent size
of the umbilicus, where the labium is, as it were, scooped out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Liotia acuticostata</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 519 a.</h5>

<p>L. t. parvâ, subglobosâ, albâ; anfr. nucl. ii. lævibus, apice satis extante;
anfr. normalibus iii., carinis in spirâ maxime extantibus ii., anfr. ult. vi.; suturis
subrectangulatis; aperturâ circulari; labro extus parum contracto; labio
conspicuo; umbilico haud magno.</p>

<p>Long. 0.12, long. spir. 0.06, lat. 0.10, div. 95°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island, 10-20 fms. 4, alive; Monterey, 4, dead, dredged?</p>

<p>This pretty little Cyclostomoid species is easily recognized by the sharp
revolving keels, and absence of radiating sculpture.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Amycla</span> H. &amp; A. Adams, 1858.</h4>

<h5><i>Amycla undata</i> Carp. n. sp. State Collection, Species 1067.</h5>

<p>A. t. parvâ rufo-fuscâ, turritâ, epidermide tenui indutâ; marginibus spiræ
subrectis; anfr. nucleosis iv. lævibus, tumidis, apice mamillato; anfr. normalibus
v. valde tumidis, suturis impressis; costis radiantibus ix. valde tumidis, latis,
antice et postice obsoletis; interstitiis undatis; liris spiralibus acutioribus, distantibus,
costas superantibus, secundum interstitia eleganter undulatis, quarum
vi.—viii. in spirâ monstrantur; aperturâ ovali, in canalem brevem rectam productâ,
intus haud liratâ; labro acuto, labio acuto extanti ad suturam juncto;
columellâ planatâ: operculo nassoideo. ?</p>

<p>Long. 0.44, long. spir. 0.20, lat. 0.20, div. 45°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island, not rare, 30-40 fm. 10, some alive.</p>

<p>The nuclear whirls in this shell resemble a minute <i>Paludina</i>. The only
operculum in the specimens sent was broken in extraction, but appeared to be
Nassoid. The sculpture consists of elongate knobs swelling in the middle;
with spiral lines hanging as it were from pier to pier, as in a suspension bridge.
The aperture is somewhat Columbelloid, the inner and outer lips joining at the
suture; but neither are lirate within, although they have that appearance from
the outside sculpture showing through.</p>

Botanique Raisonée, by Alph. DeCandolle, from the author.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper stated that he had lately learned from Mr. Gill, of
the Smithsonian Museum, that the genus <span class="smcap">Ayresia</span>, lately described
in these Proceedings, is identical with <span class="smcap">Chromis</span>, of Cuvier,
though not <i>Chromis</i> of Richardson, with which Dr. C. had compared
it. The name of the fish must therefore be changed to
<span class="smcap">Chromis Punctipinnis</span>, Cooper.</p>

<p>Col. Ransom presented, on behalf of Mr. John Wilson of this
city, some Indian relics, from the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, accompanied
by a letter of which the following is an abstract:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The relics consist of part of a foot and hair from different mummies, a string
of beads made of bone, with a few of blue stone, also part of a belt and tassel,
and a piece of very strong cloth of vegetable material. These were found by
Mr. Wilson in a cave situated on the western slope of a very high mountain of
the Sierra Madre, which seems almost to hang over the ancient Pueblo of Chiricahui—a
name signifying the Mountain of Bones. This Pueblo was occupied
by the Spaniards soon after the conquest by Cortez; and from previous
traditions it is supposed by the inhabitants that this cave, and another on the
opposite side of the valley, had been used as a place of burial by the natives
for several hundred years. It is supposed that no bodies have been deposited
there for the past hundred and fifty years, and perhaps longer.</p>

<p>On visiting the cave, Mr. Wilson found an excavation in the floor made three
or four years since by some persons digging for saltpetre-earth, partly filled in,
but still several feet deep; and exposed at the sides of this pit were several rows
of bodies placed in regular order one above another, in a remarkable state of preservation.
They were in a compact position, the knees bent up to the chin, and
the face drawn back close to the buttocks, then securely sewed up in the remarkably
strong and well-woven cloth here presented, which, on all of the four
or five bodies examined, showed the same degree of strength and perfection.
Over this was another covering of palm-leaves also sewn closely together. The
bodies were dried and shrunken, but retained their form and integuments.
Under each body were two small sticks, on which the body was laid on its
back, the feet towards the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>The circumference of the cave was about a hundred feet, and the height above
the floor, thirty or forty feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson and his companions “came to the very decided conclusion,” that
the floor of the cave, for a depth of twenty feet or more, was formed of bodies
similarly arranged in layers which had been placed there from time to time, as
they died, and covered with earth and pebbles from the sides of the mountains.
There can be no doubt that a thorough exploration of these relics would reveal
very much of the lost history of the Indian tribes of Mexico, and richly reward
the labors of the antiquarian. The excellent material of the cloth in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the bodies were sewn up, surpassing in texture and strength anything now
manufactured in Mexico, is worthy of investigation, as it may still be found
valuable for making bags, sails, etc. There was no sign of any embalming
substance by which the bodies and cloth could have been preserved, and the
only explanation suggested by Mr. Wilson is that it is due to the dryness of the
atmosphere, and the saltpetre contained in the earth. He also suggested that
the fibres of the cloth may have been derived from the “Maguey,” (Agave Americana)
or some allied plant.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Cooper remarked that the condition of the foot was
very similar to those of the Indian Mummy presented to the
Academy by Dr. J. B. Stout, January 21st, 1856, and which
had been dried by the action of the air, while protected from
the weather by a cedar canoe inverted over another containing
the body. That was in the moist climate of Shoalwater Bay,
north of the Columbia river, and Dr. Cooper who was present
at the time the body was removed by Capt. Russell in 1854,
was a witness of the fact that no preservatives had been
found with it. He also stated that the Indians of the vicinity
could not tell how long it had been there, though certainly
not a hundred years.</p>

<p>Prof. B. Silliman remarked that in his recent visit to
Arizona, east of the Mohave, he had seen what he presumed
were the morains of former glaciers on the eastern flanks of
some of the mountain ranges. They consist of rudely
stratified materials both angular and round, mingled confusedly
together and forming terrace-like spurs or embankments
radiating outwards from the curved range and appearing
to have been left there by glaciers, though no glacial polishing
and scratching of the rocks could be seen as in the Sierra
Nevada opposite Mono Lake and elsewhere. These evidences
of glaciers in Arizona were nearly under the 35th parallel of
latitude, and he believed that no evidence of glacial action had
before been observed on the Pacific slope at a point so far
south.</p>

<p>Prof. W. P. Blake observed that this was certainly the first
observation upon glacial phenomena in Arizona, and that he
had noted evidences of former glaciers in the Sierra Nevada,
as far south as the Tejon Pass, lat. 35°, where there were
large blocks of granite deposited for miles beyond the opening
of the valley.</p>

<p>Prof. Silliman described the peculiar character of the
outcrops of the veins in the regions of the El Dorado Cañon.
He found that nearly all vestiges of the sulphurets were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
removed from the outcrops, while they abounded below.
The outcrops gave little indication of the metal-bearing
character of the veins. He had observed as he believed, at
least three distinct periods of volcanic activity in that region
of the Colorado and Mohave, two of which periods were sub-aqueous,
and the last sub-aerial. The lava-streams generally
appeared to have been poured out after the face of the country
had already assumed its present form. The volcanic outflows
though extensive had not materially modified the topography
of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Ehrenberg stated that the copper ores in the vicinity
of La Paz, and Mineral City, Arizona, were generally argentiferous,
sometimes giving results by assay as high as $200 per
ton. The ores beyond that district did not appear to contain
much. The quicksilver ore at the Eugenie vein contained
both silver and copper.</p>

<h3>Notes on Californian Satyrides.</h3>

<p class="center">BY HERMAN BEHR, M. D.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chionobas Nevadensis.</span> Boisduval, <i>in litteris</i>.</h4>

<p>A few specimens of this new and as yet undescribed <i>Chionobas</i>, were caught
by Mr. Lorquin, the discoverer of the species, and named by Dr. Boisduval.
Not possessing a single specimen of this rare species, I am not able to give a
diagnosis, and have only an indistinct recollection, that the species bore most
resemblance to the <i>Gerontogeic</i>, Ch. Tarpeja, a Siberian species that has also
been found on the summit of the Appenines, in Italy, but that in size it is
superior to any <i>Chionobas</i> known to me.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Satyrus Sthenele</span> Boisd.</h4>

<p>Is rather common near San Francisco, where it is found in June. Only one
generation annually.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Satyrus Sylvestris</span> Edwards.</h4>

<p>Edwards’ description shows very clearly the marks by which <i>S. Sylvestris</i> can
be recognized from <i>S. Sthenele</i>. This species is found on grassy hills thinly
covered with live-oak, where its habits show a very marked difference from
those of its relations, by preferring the underside of oak branches to any
other seat, while <i>Sthenele</i> and <i>Boopis</i> almost exclusively settle on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Satyrus Boopis</span> Behr.</h4>

<p>Sthenele similis at limbus non tesselatus, sed linea transversa distincte partitus
et fœminæ ocelli alarum superiorum in fascia dilutiori positi. Alae subtusdimidiatæ
pars radicalis brunnea, marginalis grisea, marginem versus brunnescens.
Utraque marmorata, halone ocellorum in alis anticis solo excepto
dilutiori et concolori.</p>

<p>This <i>Satyrus</i> is the biggest of our Californian species, the male being nearly
double the size of the female of <i>S. Sylvestris</i>. I find this <i>Satyrus</i> in July in Contra
Costa, on the hills as well as on the plains. In regard to the diagnosis of
these three closely allied species, I would mention, that the presence or absence
of one or two more or less distinct eye-marks, on the upper or under
side near the anal angle of the hind wings, is of no diagnostic importance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">S. Ariane</span> Boisd.</h4>

<p>I confess I can not find any constant mark of difference between this species
and <i>S. Alope</i>, <i>Nephele</i>, and <i>Pegala</i>, however different at first glance their forms
may appear. I am very much inclined to consider them local aberrations of
one far spread species, that gradually slopes from <i>S. Pegala</i> Fabr., through <i>S.
Ariane</i> Boisd. to <i>S. Nephele</i> and <i>S. Alope</i> Fabr., in a similar way as the Gerontogeic
<i>P. Egeria</i> L. looks very different from its African form <i>P. Xiphia</i> Fabr.,
with which, nevertheless, it is insensibly united by its intermediate form <i>P.
Meone</i>.</p>

<p>All my Californian specimens agree perfectly with Dr. Boisduval’s diagnosis
of <i>S. Ariane</i>; with the exception of one that approaches to <i>S. Pegala</i>, by its
having only one eye-mark on the upper side of the anterior wings, but differs
by the entire absence of the wide rusty band on the same. The specimen
was among several undoubted <i>S. Ariane</i>, caught near Mono Lake, by Prof.
Brewer, of the State Geological Survey. Besides the above mentioned locality,
I received specimens from San Diego and Santa Cruz. Near San Francisco
the species is wanting.</p>

<p>As to <i>S. Sthenele</i> and <i>S. Sylvestris</i>, I entertain no doubts regarding their
rights as distinct species, but <i>S. Boopis</i> being only distinguished by the absence
of the series of eyes on the under side of the hind wings from <i>S. Nephele</i>,
may, perhaps, prove a local variety or aberration of that most polymorphous
and far spread species <i>S. Alope</i>. In the mean time, until the connecting
forms are found, I consider it to be specifically distinct.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Coenonympha</span> Hubner.</h4>

<h5><i>C. Galactina</i>. Boisd.</h5>

<p>I consider this species as identical with <i>C. Californica</i> Dbld. At least I find
in a long series of specimens, no point where <i>Californica</i> ends and <i>Galactina</i>
begins. <i>C. Galactina</i>, according to Boisduval, exists also in Kamtschatka. In
California it is one of the commonest species of Diurnals, and is found in the
most different localities, in several generations throughout the year. There
exists a second <i>Cœnonympha</i> in some sequestered valleys of the Northern Sierra,
that approaches in its coloration, the European <i>C. Pamphilas</i>. I have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
seen one pair of this species, and not possessing it, I can not give a diagnosis.
It may be that it is identical with <i>C. Inornata</i>, Edw., or <i>C. Ochracea</i>, Edw., or
some other Northern species.</p>

<p>Extratropical America is not rich in <i>Satyrides</i>, if compared to the same latitudes
in Europe or Asia, and California is especially poor.</p>

<p>There are seven European genera, each of them represented by a whole
series of species connecting different types. In California there are only three
of which none is known to contain more than four species.</p>

<p>The Atlantic States add some tropical genera to the three genera already
obtained in California, viz.: <i>Neonympha</i> Hubner, <i>Hyphthima</i> Hubner, <i>Debis</i>
Dbld., and <i>Calisto</i> Hubner. The genus <i>Calisto</i> seems to be confined to subtropical
North America; the genus <i>Neonympha</i> spreads in numerous species
through the tropics of America, and trespasses only in a few species the
<i>Cancer</i>; <i>Hyphthima</i> is found in many species in the tropics of the Old
World, and it is a very curious circumstance, that one species of this essentially
Gerontogeic genus should be found in the Southern States. But the two
American species of the genus <i>Debis</i>, are even more interesting, for all other
species of this genus, are confined to the Indian Archipelago.</p>

<p>The metamorphoses of the <i>Satyrides</i>, are only with difficulty to be investigated.</p>

<p>They feed as far as they are known, on Monocotyledoneous plants, the extra-tropical
ones, with one exception perhaps, exclusively on Graminaceous
plants. The Caterpillars shun the sunlight and hide themselves in the grass.
Some of them bury themselves in the daytime in the ground and feed only at
night. The tropical species feeding on Scitaminaceous, Aroideous plants,
palms, and arborescent grasses, sport the shady thickets of tropical forests, in
whose twilight depths, most of the species are also found in their imago state.
Other ones like some of the <i>Morphonides</i>, and even some <i>Nymphalides</i> of the
tropics, spend their days hidden under the luxuriant foliage of primeval forests
and begin their flight only after sunset.</p>

<p>In a most interesting treatise on the characteristics of the insect fauna of
the “White Mountains,” by Samuel H. Scudder, (Boston Journal, Vol. VII,
Part IV), I find the description of the Caterpillar of <i>Chionobas Semidea</i>, Edw.,
with a notice that it was found on Lichen. This would prove a most remarkable
exception, as all the other <i>Satyrides</i> feed on Monocotyledoneous plants.
Nevertheless, larvæ of Artic types are generally polyphagous, and adapted
to some degree, to accommodate themselves to circumstances, and so I would
not entertain any doubts about the feeding plant of the <i>Chionobas</i>, if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
not for the circumstance that Mr. Scudder confesses that he did not succeed
in bringing the Caterpillar, with Lichen, to perfection. Perhaps the Caterpillar
fed on grass, or perhaps some <i>Carex</i>, and was only, by some accident,
compelled to crawl to the lichen-covered stone, where that gentleman found
it. I hope to hear very soon about this most interesting object, for I consider
the discovery of the metamorphoses of one insect, a more valuable fact than
the diagnoses of ten new species, of which we do not know more than the external
appearance.</p>

<h3>Note on a large lump of Gold found on the Middle fork
of the American River.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>In July last, a mass of gold nearly free from quartz, was taken out of a placer
on the Middle Fork of the American River, about two miles above Michegan
Bluffs. It weighed, as taken out, 187 ounces troy, and sold for $17.50 per
ounce, netting the finder $3,272.50. In melting, a loss of six ounces was experienced.
There was a further loss to the purchaser, from the poor quality
of the gold, the assay return of which I have not yet been able to obtain.
The ordinary gold of the claim is worth $17.50. It is a singular fact, often
remarked by dealers, that the large lumps of gold are almost always poorer
in quality than the smaller ordinary grains from the same placers.</p>

<h3>Note on the Fossil remains of the Horse and Elephant,
mingled, at Mare Island, San Francisco Bay.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>The entire lower jaw and teeth of a horse, the fragments of which I exhibit
to the Academy, were taken by me from the face of the shore cliff of Mare
Island, together with broken pieces of bones of other large quadrupeds. The
teeth of an <i>Elephas</i> had been found in the same place, a few weeks before, by
Mr. Brown, the Naval Engineer, by whom my attention was directed to the
place. The fossils occur in a stiff sandy loam, which rests on the eroded surface
of the Tertiary or Cretaceous beds below. Near the surface is a layer of
oyster shells, apparently an upraised bed, most of the shells being entire.
The fact that the Horse and Elephant roamed together over our hills and
plains, at the dawn of, or before the human period, is certainly not without
interest.</p>

<h3>Ammonites or Ceratites from Oregon Bar, Middle Fork

<p class="center">BY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>The specimen which I exhibit to the Society this evening, is from the collection
of J. J. Spear, of this city. It was kindly loaned to me by that gentleman
for examination. Not wishing to risk the specimen, by sending it to a
paleontologist at the East, I had it photographed, and sent a copy to F. B.
Meek, Esq., of Washington. It is not possible to determine from the specimen,
whether these fossils are new or not, or even, whether they are <i>Ammonites</i> or
<i>Ceratites</i>. They appear to be not unlike the fossils described by Dr. Trask,
under the name of <i>A. Chiceonsis</i>, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Cal.; but it is not safe
to identify them, without the septæ can be clearly made out.</p>

<p>There are several casts in an argillaceous, somewhat micaceous slate. This
locality is about 15 miles from Coloma. It is not certain, whether the specimen
was taken from the slates in place, or broken from a loose mass.</p>

<h3>On Brushite, a new mineral occurring in Phosphatic
Guano.</h3>

<p class="center">BY GIDEON E. MOORE, PH. B.</p>

<p>In the spring of the present year, I received through the kindness of Wm.
E. Brown, Esq., of Mare Island, in this State, a specimen of a mineral discovered
by him in a cargo of phosphatic guano, at Camden, N. J. The locality
from which it was derived, is not known, and though letters of enquiry have
been sent to the parties to whom the cargo was originally consigned, no reply
has been received up to this date. The texture and appearance of the guano
would, however, point to some one of the Caribbean Islands, and more particularly,
to the Island of Sombrero, as its probable source. It is very probable
that the mineral may be recognized among the crystallized products occurring
in other guano deposits.</p>

<p>In the specimen in my possession, the mineral occurs filling seams in the
guano, varying from ⅛ to ¼ of an inch in width. The matrix itself is of the
variety known as rock guano. It possesses an oolitic structure and a brownish
white color, interspersed with small spots of pure white.</p>

<p>The mineral is in the form of small but very perfect and brilliant crystals
with a cleavage in the direction of their greatest length, nearly equal to that
of selenite; the laminæ, being also slightly flexible, as in the case of the latter
species. Hardness, 2.25 (Moh’s scale). Specific gravity, 2.208, (mean of two
determinations). Color, yellowish white. Transparent. Lustre, vitreous
splendent, inclining to pearly on the cleavage faces.</p>

<p>When heated in a closed tube before the blowpipe, it whitens and gives off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
water, at an incipient red heat. In the platina forceps, it fuses with intumescence,
at about 2. of Von Kobbell’s scale, tinging the flame with the peculiar
green characteristic of phosphoric acid. The button formed by fusion,
crystallizes on cooling, showing numerous brilliant facets. Readily soluble,
even in coarse crystals, in dilute nitric and hydrochloric acids.</p>

<p>A qualitative analysis, revealed the presence of Lime, Phosphoric acid, and
water, with barely discernable traces of Magnesia and Alumina.</p>

<p>The quantity of mineral at my disposal was very small, scarcely exceeding
one gramme in weight. In each of the following analyses, the water was determined
in 0.2 grammes, the remaining 0.3 grammes being employed in the
determination of the Lime and Phosphoric acid. The results were as follows:</p>

<table summary="Composition of the samples">
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>1.</th>

<p>In the polarizing microscope, the mineral shows a vivid succession of colors.
A sample has been sent to Prof. J. D. Dana, who has kindly undertaken the
study of its crystallographic characters, and I hope, in a short time, to be able
to communicate the results of his investigations to the Academy.</p>

<p>It is with very great pleasure, that I dedicate this species to Prof. Geo.
J. Brush, of Yale College, to whose unwearied zeal and efficient labors, American
Mineralogy stands so deeply indebted.</p>

<p>Prof. Brewer gave an account of recent explorations in the
Sierra Nevada, by the party connected with the State Geological
Survey. The exploration extended from Kern River to
the Yosemite Valley, and was peculiarly rich in scientific results.
The crest of the chain is very high; along the whole
of this distance, the high peaks, rising to above 13,000 feet,
the culmination being between the sources of the Kern and
Kings Rivers, where there are a number of peaks over 14,000
feet, and one about 15,000 feet in height. Along the whole
of this, there are abundant traces of glaciers, some of the
morains of which are truly gigantic, far surpassing anything
else of the kind yet found in the State. The cañons
of all the principal streams are very deep and abrupt.</p>

<p>The Big Trees or Sequoias, were found over a large area,
extending perhaps 25 miles along the western slope, along
the tributaries of the San Joaquin, Kings, Kaweah, Tule and
Kern Rivers. The amount of snow in this part of the sierras,
is apparently very much less than usually occurs.</p>

<h3>Note on the discovery of Fossils in the Auriferous Slate
formation of the Mariposa Estate, California, and
the probable geological age.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>During a recent visit to the Mariposa Estate, Mariposa County, my attention
was called to some organic remains in the slates, near Bear Valley, by Miss
Errington, a lady who takes an enthusiastic interest in the sciences of geology
and mineralogy, and has for some time past, been seeking for fossils in the
gold formation of that neighborhood. One of the specimens was the cast of
a bivalve shell, and appeared to me to be a <i>Plagiostoma</i>. On further search,
we found other specimens, some of which much resemble <i>Inoceramus</i>, to which
I am inclined to refer them. Certain long tubular cavities in the slates, marked
with heavy lines, and slightly converging, seemed to be casts of long, nearly
cylindrical shells, possibly <i>Nerinæa</i>. These forms would indicate a Jurassic
or Cretaceous age for the formation. I propose to submit these specimens to
a competent Palæontologist, at the East, for examination, and to dedicate one
of the species, if new, to Miss Errington.</p>

<p>Mr. Clayton made the following remarks in regard to his
donations above mentioned:</p>

<p>The teeth were found near Walkers River, about one mile
below the residence of Mr. G. E. Wellington, on the Carson
River and Aurora Road. This river cuts through a high
range of hills immediately west of Wellington’s, and enters
a large basin or valley, which is some thirty miles long, from
north to south, by twenty miles wide, from west to east.
After passing through this valley to the eastward, the river
enters another cañon of considerable extent, and then empties
into Walkers Lake, in the southwest portion of the great
basin.</p>

<p>The banks of the river are formed of gravel, sand, and
clay cement, containing soda and calcareous matter, which
forms a white crust on the surface of the stones and pebbles.
The cement bluffs along the river, are from 6 or 8 to 20 feet
high, and are cut out by changes in the channel during high
water.</p>

<p>In one of these recent cuttings, the large tooth was found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with part of the upper jaw and other portions of the skeleton.
There has been no excavation made, as yet, to uncover
other portions of the skeleton, but Mr. Wellington has promised
to have it done, and to secure as much of the skeleton
as possible, for the Society’s collections.</p>

<p>The small teeth were found about five feet below the surface
in the solid cement, by some parties that were digging a
grave. Quite a number of teeth were found, but with the
exception of the two just presented to the Society, they were
not preserved.</p>

<h3>Notes on some Fossils from the Gold Bearing Slates of
Mariposa, with description of some new species.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. M. GABB.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Miss Errington, of Bear Valley, Mariposa County,
I have had the opportunity of examining a series of fossils, discovered by that
lady on the Mariposa Estate. The shells appear to be of Jurassic age. The
genera so far recognized, are Belemnites, Nucula or Leda, Lima, Pecten, and
Pholadomya. The following are sufficiently perfect for description. Fuller
descriptions and figures will be published hereafter in the Geological Report
of the State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lima</span>, Brug.</h4>

<p><i>L. Erringtoni</i> G. Shell very oblique, sides subparallel; beaks small; anterior
end prominently rounded, sloping with a broad curve below to the base;
posterior side nearly straight, continuing upwards in a long narrow ear; anterior
ear obsolete (?).</p>

<p>Surface marked by strong concentric undulations, crossed on the upper and
posterior portions by fine radiating lines.</p>

<p>Length, 2.25 inches; width, 1 inch.</p>

<p>The specimens are all very much compressed, and may be somewhat distorted
in form, though the outlines are very nearly uniform in all of the specimens.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Pholadomya</span>, Sow.</h4>

<p><i>P. orbiculata</i> G. Compressed, sub-circular; beaks rather prominent, nearly
central; anterior end and base regularly rounded; posterior end slightly produced,
more prominent below than above. Surface ornamented by concentric
ribs, irregular in size, crossed by undulating, radiating lines on the anterior
half of the shell. These lines become gradually obsolete and disappear on or
about the middle of all of the specimens, although more perfect examples
might show them continuing further.</p>

<p>Height, from a slightly distorted specimen, 1.1 inch; width, 1.3 inch.</p>

<p>Like the preceding species, all of the specimens have suffered considerably
by compression; and had we perfect specimens, the shell would be found to be
quite convex.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Belemnites.</span></h4>

<p><i>B. Pacificus</i> G. Long, slender, tapering very gradually and with a slight
convexity to the tip. Section, sub-elliptical; alveolus deep and narrow.</p>

<p>A specimen 3 inches long, measures .35 in. in diameter in the middle. One
cast has been found with a diameter of .9 inch at the broadest part.</p>

<p>I first discovered this species, as imperfect casts, in the slates near Spanish
Flat, El Dorado County. Since then, numerous fragments and casts have
been found at Mariposa, by Mr. C. R. King and Miss Errington.</p>

<h3>Communication on the San Luis Obispo Quicksilver
Fossils.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. M. GABB.</p>

<p>Mr. Attwood has recently presented to the collection of the State Geological
Survey, a series of Fossils collected by himself, in the formation in which the
San Luis Obispo cinnabar deposits occur.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Prof. B. Silliman, Jr. I have had the opportunity
of examining another small collection, made by that gentleman, at the same

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fossils, though few in number of species, point unequivocally to the

<h3>On the Crystallization of Brushite.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JAMES D. DANA, L.L.D., PROFESSOR OF MINERALOGY IN YALE COLLEGE.</p>

<p>The specimens of the mineral Brushite, which I have had under crystallographic
examination, were received from Mr. G. E. Moore, the discoverer of
the species.</p>

<p>The crystals are slender prisms, not over a third of an inch in length. A
common form (containing all the observed planes), is shown in
the annexed figure. The prisms are monoclinic, and are often
flattened, parallel to the clinodiagonal, as here represented.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;" id="fig26">
<img src="images/fig26.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Cleavage is perfect, parallel of the clinodiagonal section, or
the plane <i>iì</i>; also distinct parallel to the line <i>cl</i>, as apparent often
in the cross fractures of the crystals, and by occasional striæ.
This plane of cleavage may be taken as the basal plane <i>O</i>.</p>

<p>The planes <i>I</i> and l are brilliant, especially the former. The
oblique plane situated on the back side in the figure, and which
may be called <i>r</i>, is quite rough, owing to the oscillatory combination
between two hemi-octahedral planes. In many of the
crystals, only the right one of the two planes <i>I</i> is present, and
also only the left one of the two planes l. The prisms frequently terminate
above in an irregular edge, made by the meeting of the one, or two, planes <i>I</i>,
and the rough plane <i>r</i>, and this edge is sometimes cut off, more or less deeply,
by a single oblique plane, which is one of the planes l.</p>

<p>According to measurements with the reflective goniometer;</p>

<p>The inclination of the I on l could not be accurately measured, on account
of the minuteness of the planes in the crystals, in which both planes occur,
and the want of perfection in the reflection. The angle obtained for l:<i>iì</i>
would give, for l:l, 156° 40’.</p>

<p>By measurement with a goniometer attached to a compound microscope, the
plane angle between the lines of cross cleavage, or <i>cl</i>, and the edge <i>I</i>:<i>I</i>
(which equals the inclination of <i>O</i> on the orthodiagonal section, or a plane <i>ii</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was found to be 117-117½°; and that between edge <i>I</i>:<i>I</i> and edge l:l (which
equals <i>ii</i> on l<i>i</i>, both unobserved planes) 95°-95½°: whence <i>O</i>:l<i>i</i> would equal
approximately 147° 30’. The inclination of the rough plane <i>r</i> on the edge
l:l is about 110°, but varies much.</p>

<p>The results of calculation, taking as data the above mentioned angles <i>I</i>:<i>I</i>
and l:<i>ii</i>, along with the inclination of <i>O</i> to <i>ii</i> = 117° 15’, and that of the
edge l:l (or l<i>ì</i>) to <i>ii</i> = 95° 15’ are as follows:</p>

<p class="center">C (= O : <i>iì</i>) = 117° 15’ and 62° 45’</p>

<p class="center"><i>a</i> (vert. axis) : <i>O</i> (clinodiag.) : <i>c</i> = 0.5396 : 1 : 2.614</p>

<p class="center">l : l = 156° 46’</p>

<p class="center">-l : -l (unobserved planes) = 164° 22’</p>

<p>The species is related in form to Vivianite, in which</p>

<p class="center"><i>a</i> : <i>b</i> : 2<i>c</i> = 1.0792 : 1 : 2.614.</p>

<p>The crystals of the two species are also alike in the perfect and pearly clinodiagonal
cleavage.</p>

<h3>On new Californian Marine Shells. No. II.</h3>

<p class="center">BY PHILIP P. CARPENTER, PH. D., OF WARRINGTON, ENGLAND.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Collonia</span>, <i>Gray</i>, 1852.</h4>

<p>This genus was established (in English) by Dr. Gray, for Turbinate shells
having an “operculum circular, with many gradually enlarged whirls, with a
convex external rib and central pit.” The type (still appearing as such in the
B. M. Col.) is a smooth fossil from Grignon, = Delphinula marginata, Lam.,
with a keeled and crenated umbilicus, like Phillippia. Another (African)
shell is joined to the diagnosis, with the following brief description: “C.
striata, <i>Gray</i>. Shell red, white marbled, striated.” It is quoted by Phillippi,
Handb. Conch. p. 206, who assigns as a type T. sanguineus, <i>Linn.</i> For this
species and its congeners, we now propose a subgenus <span class="smcap">Leptonyx</span>, as they do
not agree with the type. The genus was reconstituted by Messrs. Adams,
Gen. i. 396 for shells with “imperforate axis and contracted aperture:” the
description of the operculum being copied from Gray. The type is now “C.
marginata, <i>Nutt.</i>” pl. 44, f. 2, the operculum of which is figured as with <i>few</i>
whirls. The same description and figure are given in Chenu, Manuel i. 348, f.
2560. The error seems to have arisen thus. Mr. H. Adams (who acted for the
‘firm’ during his brother’s long absence in Japan,) probably took Gray’s C.
marginata to be the ‘Turbo marginatus, Nutt.’ of Reeve, and from this species
as type, described the genus to be imperforate, etc. Unfortunately, Dr. Gray
did not observe the error, which had arisen from confounding two different
shells called marginatus; and in his guide to Mollusca (in loco) he adopts the
description of Messrs. Adams; so that Collonia, <i>Gray</i>, (hodie) = Collonia,
<i>Add.</i>, but not Collonia, <i>Gray</i>, (olim). Of the species arranged by Mr. H.
Adams under Collonia, some may belong to the original genus: some are included
under Cynisca, <i>A. Ad.</i>; and one (Turbo phasianella, <i>C. B. Ad.</i>) appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to be Eucosmia. They appear in the Br. Mus. Col. distributed between Gibbula
and Photinula. The true Turbo marginatus of Nutt. is the ordinary black
Californian Chlorostoma, like mœstus, and well named from its frilled margin
near the suture. But the label having become affixed to the T. marginatus
<i>Rve.</i> (which must stand as Reeve’s species and not Nuttall’s) the Californian
shell was left without name, and was described by Mr. A. Adams as Chl. funebrale,
under which name it must stand as Nuttal’s prior name was (unfortunately)
in MS. only. The name Collonia marginata must stand for the original
fossil of Lamarck. It is probable that Reeve’s shell belongs to another group;
else it must, according to the usual custom of honoring error, be called C.
Reevei. For the Californian species, which are imperforate and have a thin,
smooth operculum, Mr. A. Adams and I propose to form a subgenus <i>Leptonyx</i>;
a diagnosis of which will appear in the next paper, after the foreign
species have been examined. The following are the Californian forms.</p>

<h5><i>Leptonyx sanguineus</i>, Linn.</h5>

<p>H. t. parvâ, solidâ, rubrâ, anfr. V. subtumentibus, suturis plus minusve impressis;
costulis spiralibus plus minusve rotundatis cinctâ, quarum iv.-viii. in
spirâ monstrantur; aperturâ subcirculari; columellâ t. adolescente foveâ basali
et dente ut in ‘Modulo’ munitâ; adultâ, callositate tenui labiali, foveam tegente,
obscure bidentatâ; labio tenui, continuo; umbilico nullo.</p>

<p><i>Hab</i>. Mediterranean, <i>Phillippi</i>, <i>Hanley</i>. Japan, <i>A. Adams</i>. Monterey, <i>Jewett</i>,
<i>Taylor</i>, <i>Cooper</i>. Neeah Bay, W.T., <i>Swan</i>.</p>

<p>= Turbo sanguineus, Ln. Syst. Nat. Ed. 12, p. 1235:—Phil. Moll. Sic. in
loco: Hanl. Ips. Lin. Conch, in loco.</p>

<p>= T. Belliæi, Michaud in Mus. Paris: teste Hanl.</p>

<p>Non “Turbo sanguineus, Linn.” Rve. Conch. Ic. sp. 55: = T. coccineus,
<i>Desh.</i> = Globulus roseus, Chem. teste Rve. Nec (Gibbula) sanguinea, <i>Risso</i>.</p>

<p>Reeve says of his shell. “I am not quite sure that this is the T. sanguineus
of Linnæus, but <i>have every reason</i> to believe it is.” That is, every reason except
the one only convincing proof, which was so easy to a London naturalist,
an inspection of the original type in the Linnæan Collection. A mere glance
at this would have exposed his error. Reeve’s shell is whitish, with blood-red
spots, and is probably a S. African species. Whether Linnæus described
from Mediterranean or Japanese specimens, cannot be told from his rubbed
shells; nor as yet have sufficiently perfect specimens been compared from the
two oceans; but no character has been observed by which they can be separated.
The great author obtained his Algerine and his Philippine shells from
the Swedish consuls; and Japanese species may have been mixed with the latter.
It is very rare in the Mediterranean; common in Japan; common also at
Vancouver; but rare further south. It is, we believe, the only Californian
shell described by the father of modern Natural History. The specimens vary
very greatly in strength of sculpture. There is also a purple variety.</p>

<h5><i>Leptonyx</i> (<i>sanguineus</i>, var.) <i>purpureum</i>.</h5>

<p>H. t. ‘H. sanguineo’ simili, sed purpureo fuscâ; lirulis spiralibus crebioribus,
interstitiis parvis, labio obsoleto.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Sta. Cruz, <i>Rowell</i>. Monterey, <i>Cooper</i>. Neeah Bay, <i>Swan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Leptonyx bacula</i>, Carp.</h5>

<p>L. t. “L. sanguineo, jun.” simili; sed rufocinereâ, sculpturâ obsoletâ;
anfr. iv. planatis, suturis vix distinctis, marginibus spiræ valde excurvatis;
lirulis obsoletis latioribus, et circa basim striis crebris, vix sculptâ; apertura
rotundatâ, declivi; columellâ vix callosâ.</p>

<p>Long. 0.08, long. spir. 0.06; lat. 0.14.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Is., dead on beach; <i>Cooper</i>, No. 1056.</p>

<p>This unpretending little shell resembles on the back one of the small Helicinæ.
It differs from L. sanguineus in its small size, ashy color, flattened
sutures, and nearly obsolete sculpture. A groove in the somewhat callous
columella, continued slightly round the labrum, seems intended for the broad-margined
operculum of the genus.</p>

<h3>On Californian Lepidoptera.</h3>

<p class="center">BY HERMAN BEHR, M. D.</p>

<h4>ERYCINIDÆ</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Nemeobius</span> Boisd.</h5>

<h6><i>N. Dumeti</i> Behr.</h6>

<p>Alæ supra nigræ, fasciis duabus albis signatæ, altera medias per alas transgrediente,
altera per spatium inter fasciam mediam et marginem, utraque hinc interrupta
vel macalari. Alæ anteriores a radice ad fasciam mediam fulvæ, maculis
quatuor quadrangularibus nigro marginatis signatæ.</p>

<p>Alæ subtus grisescentes, marginem versus dilutiores. Anteriores a radice ad
fasciam mediam fulvæ, ceterum ut supra signatæ, posteriores fascias demonstrant
ut supra, sed confluentes, et hinc coufusas.</p>

<p>This species is found in some parts of California, and always in localities that
are covered by the peculiar vegetation called Chaparral.</p>

<h6><i>N Virgulti</i>, Behr.</h6>

<p>Alæ supra nigræ, fulvo mixtæ, fasciis duabus signatæ, altera medias per alas
transgrediente, colore fulvo fere ubique obducta, altera per spatium inter fasciam
mediam et marginem ad punctorum alborum seriem reducta.</p>

<p>Alæ anteriores usque ad marginem fere fulvæ, fascia intermedia maculisque
disci albis, nigro marginatis. Margo alarum anteriorum, alæque posteriores totæ
grisescentes punctis maculisque albis, nigro marginatis variegatæ.</p>

<p>This species was found near Los Angeles, by Mr. Lorquin, who gave me several
specimens. In the male the black color is more predominating, in the
female the fulvous coloration.</p>

<p>For the sake of completing this series of diagnoses, I give here the description
of a third species, that I received, by the kindness of Dr. Dinklage, from the
Sierra Madre, in the neighborhood of Mazatlan. I think it indispensable to give
the marks of this closely allied Nemeobius, as I am of the opinion that thus errors
will most effectually be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<h6><i>N. Mejicanus</i>, Behr.</h6>

<p>Alæ supra fulvæ, marginem versus brunneæ, fasciis maculisque ordinariis omnibus
albis nigro marginatis instructæ. Subtus alæ anteriores fulvæ, apice et margine
grisescentes, fasciis et maculis ut supra. Alæ posteriores grisescentes, macalis
albis et nigro marginatis et confluentibus cum colore universali irregulariter
variegatæ.</p>

<p>The most positive and striking points of difference would be thus:</p>

<p>1. <i>N. Dumeti.</i> Fore wings alone show a fulvous coloration on the upperside.
Bands and spots perfectly white.</p>

<p>2. <i>N. Mejicanus.</i> All wings are occupied with it, till beyond the second band,
where the brownish coloration of the margin begins. Bands and spots perfectly
white.</p>

<p>3. <i>N. Virgulti.</i> Extension of the fulvous as in the preceding, but all the space
more or less occupied by black. Middle band nearly altogether fulvous, other
bands and spots white.</p>

<p>As much as we know, the type of this genus <i>N. Lucina</i> L, was the only species
known heretofore, and it is another proof of the various repetition of types on
occidental coasts, that we have to add three Pacific representatives of a genus first
discerned in a single European species.</p>

<p>The group of the <i>Erycinides</i> belongs essentially to tropical America. The
beforementioned <i>Nemeobius Lucina</i> is the only European representative of this numerous
and polymorphous group. Besides this, there exist some few Asiatic
members of this family, very aberrant in their type, scarcely known and insufficiently
examined, so that possibly they may belong somewhere else. In America
the tropical genera <i>Nymphidia</i> and <i>Lemonias</i>, extend beyond the Cancer on the
Atlantic side; but on the Pacific side reappears the European genus <i>Nemeobius</i>,
extending into the Tropics, and seems to find here its very centre.</p>

<h3>Description of New Species of Land Shells.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. NEWCOMB, M.D.</p>

<h4><i>Helix Blakeana</i>, Newc.</h4>

<p>Hel. testa unicolor flavido-alba, rotundato, semi-globosa, nitida, translucida;
umbilico amplo, profundo et parum obtecto; apice obtuso; anfractibus sex, convexis,
tribus superioribus sub-planis, reliquiis rapide accrescentibus, ultimo inflato;
sutura bene impressa; aperturâ rotundato-lunare; peristomate tenue, ex
panso-reflexo cum columellâ sub-late dilatatâ, non adnatâ.</p>

<p>Alt. ·7 pol., Diam maj. 1·1 pol., min. 1· pol.</p>

<p>Hab. Insula Niphon—Japan, (teste Blake).</p>

<p>Shell uniformly yellowish white, rounded, half globular, shining, translucent;
umbilicus large, deep and slightly covered; apex obtuse; whorls six, convex, the
three first nearly on the same plane, the balance rapidly increasing, the last
swollen; suture well marked; aperture roundly lunar; lip thin, flatly reflected, at
the columella broadly dilated but not adherent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In general form and color, this species makes a nearer approach to <i>H.
candida</i>, Moricand, than to any species with which I am acquainted. It varies
in the less elevation, in the form of the spire, and in some other respects. Professor
Blake had remarkable facilities for collecting in Japan, but unfortunately
the mice proved so destructive to his terrestrial shells, as to leave him but few
specimens as the result of his labor.</p>

<h4><i>Helix declivis</i>, Newc.</h4>

<p>Hel. testa perspectivo-umbilicata, lenticulare, oblique striata, tenue, pallide-cornea;
anfr. IV, planulatis, ultimo declivi, in medio sub-carinato; sutura sub-canuliculata;
peris. fragile, simplici: apertura obliquo-sub-rotundata.</p>

<p>Alt. ·1 pol., Diam. maj. ·3 pol., min. ·2 pol.</p>

<p>Hab. Insula Niphon, (Japan).</p>

<p>Shell perspectively umbilicate, lenticular, obliquely striate, thin, pale horn
color; whorls four, planulate, the last shelving down to the centre, which is obscurely
keeled; suture channelled; lip fragile, simple; aperture oblique, almost
round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—Bears some resemblance to <i>H. ruderata</i>, Stud., a species common
in Europe, from which it may readily be distinguished by comparison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The Japanese species herein described, were collected by Professor
Blake, in the interior of the Island of Niphon, out of the range permitted to
foreign travel.</p>

<p>The Professor, who was employed by the Japanese Government as a special
geologist, had the privilege of penetrating districts not before visited by any
scientific or mercantile foreigner. The following species of Helices were also
among those collected:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Helix peliomphala</i>, Pfr., (Mon. Hel. viv. Vol. 4, Sp. 1764).</li>
<li><i>H. quesita</i>, Deshayes, (Reeve’s Mon. fig. 1355).</li>
<li><i>H. Perryi</i>, Jay, (Perry’s Exped. Vol. 2, page 294, Plate 5, fig. 7, 8, 9).</li>
<li><i>H. Simoda</i>, Jay, (do. fig. 1 to 6).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some doubt may exist as to the <i>H. quesita</i> being identical with <i>H. Perryi</i>.
But one specimen was preserved, and this fully agrees with the description and
figure of the first named, but the locality for the species is given as the “<i>Moluccas</i>.”</p>

<p>It also agrees (except in colour) with Dr. Jay’s description, and also in the
very poor figures illustrating the species of <i>H. Perryi</i>. The only question in my
mind is one regarding locality.</p>

<h4><i>Helix Cronkhitei</i>, Newc.</h4>

<p>Hel. testa aperta umbilicata, depressa, luteo-cornea sub-lente regulariter costulato-striata;
spira depressa-convexa; sutura excavata; anfractibus quatuor,
sub-cylindraceis; umbilica ampla, sub-perspectiva; apertura rotundata; peristomate
simplici, acuto, marginibus conniventibus.</p>

<p>Alt. ·15 pol., Diam. maj. ·2 pol., min. ·15 pol.</p>

<p>Hab. Klamath Valley, Oregon, (Gabb).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Shell openly umbilicate, depressed, yellowish horn colour, under the glass
regularly rib striated; spire depressed, a little convex; suture wide and deep;
whorls four, rather cylindrical; umbilicus large, indistinctly perspective; aperture
rounded; lip simple, acute, margins approximating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—Mr. Bland may <i>possibly</i> refer to this species as <i>H. striatella</i>, Anthony,
which was obtained by Dr. Cooper on the Pacific side of the Rocky
Mountains. (See addenda to “Remarks on Classification, etc.,” 1863). This
species is certainly distinct from <i>striatella</i>, by its smaller size, rib-like costa, and
almost channelled suture.</p>

<p>A few specimens were obtained by Mr. Gabb, of the State Geological Survey,
in Klamath Valley, which were collected jointly by himself and Dr. Cronkhite, U.
S. Army.</p>

<h4><i>Helix Rowelli</i>, Newc.</h4>

<p>Hel. testa aperta-umbilicata, orbiculato depressa, alba, opaca, polita, minutissimo-oblique
striata; anfractibus quatuor vel quinque convexis, ultimo magno
antice deflexo; spira vix elevata, apice sub-mamillato; sutura modice impressa;
apertura fere circulari; labro tenui, reflexiusculo, marginibus continuis ad juncturam;
anfr. ultimo adnato.</p>

<p>Alt. ·4 pol., Diam. maj. ·6 pol., min. ·5 pol.</p>

<p>Hab. Arizona, (dicto Frick).</p>

<p>Shell with open umbilicus, orbicular, depressed, opaque white, polished, very
finely obliquely striate; whorls four and a half, convex, the last large, anteriorly
descending; spire but little elevated, at the apex projecting like a nipple; suture
moderately marked; aperture truly circular; lip thin, slightly reflected, margins
continued, adhering to the last whirl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>—This is another of the Cyclostomoid species of which <i>H. Carpenteri</i>,
Newc., <i>H. Cærulano</i>, Muhl., and <i>H. Angasiana</i>, Pfr. form striking examples.
Our species approaches nearer in lightness of substance and in its depressed
form to Muhlfeldt’s shell, than to either the others.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in dedicating this species to the Rev. M. Rowell, of San Francisco.</p>

<h4><i>Succinea Japonica</i>, Newc.</h4>

<p>S. testa ovato-conica, flavido-cornea, lævissima, striatula, nitida, pellucida; anfractibus
III, nucleo sane mamillato, ultimo 4·5 longitudinis fere æquante; apertura
elongato-ovali; peristomate simplici; columellâ regulariter arcuata ad juncturam
labro superiorem acuto-angulata.</p>

<p>Long. ·55, Diam. ·35, Apert. long. ·4, lata. ·233 pol.</p>

<p>Hab. Japan, (Prof. Blake).</p>

<p>Shell ovately-conic, yellowish horn color, very smooth, finely striate, shining,
pellucid; whirls three, nucleus truly mamillate, the last four-fifths of the entire
length; aperture elongately ovate; lip simple; columella regularly arched; at the
juncture of the lip above, acutely angular.</p>

<h4><i>Remarks on Helix Hillebrandi</i>, Newc.</h4>

<p>At the time of publication of this species, but a single recent specimen had
been obtained, and that was freed from the epidermis. The statement that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
shell was <i>hirsute</i>, was founded upon the cicatrices observed upon the surface, Mr.
Gabb, who has recently returned from a trip to Mariposa, was successful in finding
a few specimens, by which the diagnosis may be enlarged, and conjecture resolved
into certainty. The whole surface is covered with an epidermis, of a yellowish
brown colour, thickly studded with slightly curved rigid hairs about one-twentieth
of an inch in length. The animal is of a reddish brown color, with the
tentacles of a smoky hue; tentacular sheaths darker than the body, which is
small, slender, finely granulated and unusually long and tapering behind.</p>

<p>The shell bears the same relations to <i>H. Dupetit Thouarsi</i>, Deshayes, that <i>Helix
infumata</i>, Gould, bear to <i>H. fidelis</i>, Gray. In the description of <i>infumata</i>, an
important omission occurs, owing doubtless to the imperfect condition of the type
specimen. In good specimens, all of the last whirl, except a circle round the
umbilicus, is covered with <i>very short</i> and thickly studded soft hairs, feeling harsh

<p>Hab. Insula Sandwich, (Maui).</p>

<p>Shell perforated, left handed, elongately sub-cylindrical, shining, reddish-brown,
with painting of elongate, inosculating black veins; whirls six convex, regularly
(but slowly) increasing; apex a little obtuse; suture moderately impressed, not
emarginate; aperture small, sub-ovate; lip acute; columella white, short, almost
straight, truncate, terminating by a twisted plait passing within.</p>

<p>This species is more cylindrical than any of its congeners, resembling most <i>A.
Renyi</i>, Newc., which is longer, not umbilicate, more pointed at the apex, with a
twisted, not truncate columella.</p>

<p>From <i>venusta</i> and <i>citrina</i>, Mighels, it varies both in form and color. With
some varieties of <i>picta</i> it claims analogy only in the general plan of painting.
Its striking characteristics are its blunt apex, slightly rounded whorls, small aperture,
short and white columella, umbilicus, and general plan of coloring.</p>

<p>A few specimens were collected at an elevation of 7,500 feet, on West Maui,
by the Rev. M. Alexander, to whom the species is dedicated.</p>

<h3>Description of New Species of Marine Shells from the
Coast of California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. M. GABB.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the shells collected by Dr. J. G. Cooper, of the
State Geological Survey, during his explorations along the coast of this State.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
The specimens are preserved in the collection of the Survey; most of them appear
to be very rare in a living state, though I have encountered several of them in the
later Tertiary deposits, especially in the Post Pliocene.</p>

<p>This little shell looks not unlike the young of <i>Pleurotoma Carpenteriana</i>, <i>supra</i>,
but on a critical comparison, shows several characters incompatible with such a
reference; the strongest of these is the peculiar shape of the posterior sinus. In
addition to this, the whorls of the present species are much more numerous in
proportion to the size, the first six whorls of <i>P. Carpenteriana</i> making a shell
three or four times the diameter of this one.</p>

<h3>Earthquakes in California during 1864.</h3>

<p class="center">BY DR. JOHN B. TRASK.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feb. 26th</span>, 0 h. 40 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San Francisco. At
5 h. 45 m. a smart shock, having three distinct vibrations. On the day previous,
an “<i>Electric Storm</i>” prevailed between Visalia, Tulare Co., and Los Angeles,
which was very violent in its effects on the telegraph lines.</p>

<p>On the 27th, a heavy “Norther” commenced and continued till the eve of the
28th. This earthquake was felt at San José, fifty miles south, at the same hour,
and was marked by two very smart shocks following each other in quick succession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 5th</span>, 8 h. 49 m.—A smart shock of earthquake at San Francisco. The
earthquake began at the above hour. The first wave was in a direction north
and south, and lasted one and three-fourths seconds. Nearly one and a half
seconds elapsed before the second shock, which occurred at forty-nine minutes,
three seconds past eight o’clock, and had a duration of one and one-half seconds.
The motion in this shock was rotatory.</p>

<p>Magnetism was <i>not</i> suspended in this nor either of the other shocks, this year.
The total length of time included in this earthquake, was nearly 5 seconds. These
observations were made at the height of 20 feet 4 inches above the ground,
but persons situated at a greater height felt the vibrations longer and more
severely.</p>

<p>We have brief details of this earthquake from Santa Rosa, at the north, to Santa
Cruz at the south, and from Stockton at the east, for which we acknowledge our
obligations to the Telegraph Company. At Santa Rosa it occurred at 8 h. 50 m.
the shock was light. At Petaluma 8 h. 50 m., also light. At Stockton <i>about</i> 9 h.,
shock was severe. At Santa Clara 8 h. 40 m., the shocks were very severe. The
church spires waved to and fro, and the earthquake is reported to have continued
over two minutes, with light vibrations between the heavier waves. At Santa
Cruz no time is given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 10th</span>, 14 h. 8 m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="ditto">”</span> ” 16 h. 30 m.—Another shock at San Francisco, marked by two
distinct vibrations and lasting three and one-half seconds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 20th</span>, 23 h. 45 m.—A light shock of earthquake having four distinct
tremors, and occupying a little more than three seconds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March 22d</span>, 13 h. 0 m.—A smart shock was felt at Stockton, causing some
little commotion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May 20th</span>, 18 h. 1 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San Francisco. At
Stockton the shock was quite severe and occurred nine minutes later. At San
José it also was very sharp. At Napa the earthquake, which was quite severe at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
this place, occurred at 18 h. 57 m. At Sacramento the shocks occurred at 18 h.:
and was very severe. There were two distinct waves felt at this locality. This
earthquake was felt as far north as Long Valley, in Mendocino County, and was
followed by two loud reports like artillery, almost instantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 6th</span>, 11 h. 7 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">June 22d</span>, 20 h. 53 m.—A smart shock of earthquake at San Francisco, consisting
of three distinct waves and a profound low rumbling sound. Each of the
shocks were marked by a peculiar abruptness, like sudden sharp jolts. They
were followed by a series of lessening tremors which gradually died away.</p>

<p>This earthquake was felt as far north as Healdsburg, (about 80 miles distant),
at Napa, at Pacheco, at Stockton, and at San José, south of this city fifty-two
miles, making a distance of one hundred and thirty-two miles, north and south,
over which its influence was well marked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 5th</span>, 20 h. 3 m.—An earthquake at San Francisco, not severe; this consisted
of four distinct vibrations occurring during a period of seven minutes. The
second vibration and the longest lasted nineteen seconds. The shortest vibration
was six seconds in length. The elapsed time between the waves varied from
forty seconds to one and one-fourth minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 21st</span>, 2 h. 7 m.—A smart shock was felt at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="ditto">”</span> ” 22 h. 40 m. 38 s.—A very smart shock of earthquake at San Francisco,
consisting of two waves at four seconds apart. The direction of the motion
was north thirteen degrees east. The displacement was one and a fourth inches,
at twenty feet four inches from the ground. Pendulum suspension eighteen inches.</p>

<p>The earthquake was experienced at San José at the same hour, and consisted
of four strong shocks. At Stockton the earthquake was severe, and took place
twelve minutes later than at this city. The earthquake was felt at Los Angeles,
but was not very heavy. No time is given from this latter locality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">July 25th</span>, 23 h. 56 m.—A shock of earthquake at Los Angeles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aug. 18th</span>, 5 h. 18 m.—A very strong shock of earthquake was experienced at
Grass Valley and Nevada, which threw down a wall of stone and brick in the
well of Dr. Fellows. This earthquake was felt at Gibsonville at the north and
at Marysville to the west; at the latter locality it was twelve minutes later than
at Grass Valley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oct. 6th</span>, 21 h. 9 m.—A smart shock of earthquake at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oct. 14th</span>, 1 h. 8 m.—Two heavy shocks of earthquake were felt at Mission
San Juan, and another severe shock at 10 h. 25 m., the movement was from west
to east.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dec. 11th</span>, 20 h. 52 m.—A shock of earthquake at San Francisco. This shock
was felt at San José at 20 h. 51 m., and was evidently more severe there than at
San Francisco.</p>

<p>During 1864, we have had twenty-one days on which earthquakes have occurred,
and of at number there have been two days, (March 10th and July 21st) in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
which more than one shock has taken place within the twenty-four hours of each
day.</p>

<p>The <i>British Colonist</i>, of Victoria, Vancouver Island, furnishes the following
statement:</p>

<p>From a gentleman who has resided on Vancouver Island for 15 years, we learn
that slight earthquakes have occurred annually, with one or two exceptions, during
the entire period. Only on one occasion (1858) does he remember experiencing
a shock at all approaching in severity that of Saturday morning, October 29th
1864. The oscillation, as on this last occasion, has almost invariably been from
west to east: and he accounts for this, by supposing that the internal convulsion
of the earth beneath, has to find vent in the crater of Mount Baker, situated to
the east of us. This volcano has not had any visible eruption for several years.
On the last occasion, it sent up a dense volume of smoke, and occasionally a
bright flame was seen to issue from the fiery furnace. Another old resident informs
us, that the appearance of the summit of Mount Baker has undergone a
material change within late years, giving room for the conjecture that large portions
have crumbled away and descended into the yawning abyss of the crater
which lies between the two highest peaks.</p>

<p>Relating to earthquakes at San Francisco and its immediate vicinity, we have
an item of interesting information relating to their effects at the Farrallones
Islands, situated some fifteen miles to the west of the city. It appears, upon the
testimony of the lighthouse-keeper at these Islands, and who has resided there
for several years, (seven or eight), that but <i>two</i> of the whole number occurring at
this city, have been felt at the Islands, and of these he made an official record.
The first was the shock of Dec. 23d, 1862, and that of June 22d, 1864.</p>

<p>From 1857 to date, we have seven years, during which time twenty-five shocks
have been authenticated at San Francisco, while two only of the number have
been felt at the above locality west of the city.</p>

<h3>New Mineral Oil Regions in the Tulare Valley.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>Recent examinations of prospecting parties, have added largely to the well-known
oil-bearing portions of the State. A district some sixty miles in length, on
the inner slopes of the Coast mountains, towards the Tulare Valley, has been
found to abound in oil springs, or indications of oil. Oil exudes from the surface
in large quantities, and collects rapidly in small pits sunk by prospectors. The
soil about these pits is very black and saturated with oil. The gases escaping
from this soil are inflammable, and many of the prospectors have been startled to
see flames spreading over the ground, beyond their camp fires. In digging pits
about these springs, large quantities of bones of various kinds have been thrown
out, and all are wonderfully well preserved. These bones appear chiefly those of
the horse, deer, and elk, though there are many others which I have not been
able to recognize. The teeth of the horse, sent to me, are of unusual size, and
induce the question, whether they are not of greater antiquity than the present
race of horses. I am assured that the variety of bones and teeth of many kinds
is very great.</p>

<p>The oil found gives an excellent article for lubricating purposes, and must be
very similar to the oil found near Zanesville, Ohio, according to the descriptions
given of the latter.</p>

<h3>Note upon the occurrence of Sphene in the Granite of
the Sierra Nevada.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>Sphene, in small hair-brown or amber-colored crystals, appears to be abundantly
distributed in the granite of the Sierra Nevada. It may be found at the
sources of the American River, in the exposures of granite about Slippery Ford,
and other points, and upon the Mokelumne River, further south. The crystals
are seldom more than the thirty second part of an inch in diameter, and are not
conspicuous, but may be found in almost any specimen of the rocks.</p>

<p>It appears, that this mineral is also of common occurrence in the granite of the
British Islands. In a report to the British Association, (1863) upon the composition
of the granite of Donegal, it is stated, that the rock contains, almost
universally, small crystals of sphene, in some varieties so abundantly, as to induce
the authors of the Report to term it “sphene granite.” It is also observed that
this mineral has long been known to exist in the granite of parts of Scotland, and
in that of Galway.</p>

Mazatlan, as to the efficacy of the <i>Euphorbia prostrata</i>, as a
remedy for the bite of the rattlesnake and venomous insects:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Euphorbia Prostrata as a remedy for the bite of
venomous animals.</h3>

<p class="center">BY MAJOR EDWARD PREISS.</p>

<p class="right">Mazatlan, January 7th, 1865.</p>

<p>...I send you herewith a sample of Gollindrinera, (Spanish,) <i>Euphorbia prostrata</i>,
(Linn.) It is found growing in the territories of New Mexico and Arizona, in the
United States, and the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa, in Mexico. In Jalisco
this plant is more scarce, and occurs mostly in a poor condition.</p>

<p>It thrives in hard, sandy or stony soil, and therefore is most frequently found
on roadsides, in the streets of villages and in house-yards. In Mazatlan I found a
plant with branches, measuring two feet.</p>

<p>It is a remedy against the bites of snakes and other venomous animals.</p>

<p>During my voyage in New Mexico, I camped on the 5th of June, 1864, at noon,
between Cubera and Pawate, near a waterhole. A Pueblo-Indian approached
me, and entered into a conversation. He could read and write Spanish, and was
very well versed on the map of the country. Noticing a snake in the waterhole,
I asked him whether there were many rattlesnakes in those parts, to which he
gave an affirmative answer. On questioning him whether Indians frequently
died from snake-bites, he answered: “No, as they have an antidote against the
poison.” At my request, accompanied by a gift of some cigarritos, he brought
me a plant, which he gathered from the roadside, and which he called “Gollindrinera.”
He told me that nobody ever died, not even from the bite of a rattlesnake,
if this plant was applied in time. At the same time he told how it was
used.</p>

<p>In Mexico I also found the country people well acquainted with the property
of this plant. They apply it when their domestic animals are injured by venomous
amphibia or insects.</p>

<p>The branches and roots of this plant contain a quantity of a milky sap. This
is obtained by pounding and squeezing the plant, and is given to the patient in
doses of about one drachm. The remaining fibres of the pressed-out plant are
externally applied on the wound. The dose is repeated every hour,—or in aggravated
cases, every half hour,—until the patient feels relieved; which will occur
in a few hours. The external application must be frequently renewed.</p>

<p>I ascertained from reliable authority, that two dogs, being bitten by rattlesnakes,
were cured, one after four, and the other after six repetitions of the dose.
The poultice was frequently changed. Both dogs were perfectly restored within
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class="right">Tepic, March 28th, 1865.</p>

<p>...Myself and companion arrived on the 14th of March, 1865, at 3 o’clock P. M.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
at San Blas. In the evening, our faces, necks and hands were badly bitten by
myriads of sandflies. The sting of these flies is exceedingly painful, and the effects
of them last for several days. Every person visiting San Blas will not easily forget
these insects; each sting produces a reddish swelling, which hardens after awhile,
and sometimes remains for eight days and more. We left San Blas on the 15th
of March, at 1.30 A. M., and arrived at 5 P. M. at Tepic. The fly-bites were excruciatingly
painful. On the 16th we used liquid ammoniac to allay our suffering,
but without result. In the forenoon of the 17th I found two small Gollindrinera
plants in the streets of Tepic; I pulled it, roots and all, from the ground, broke
them into several parts, and rubbed the milky juice over my sores. In half an
hour all the pain had left. Not being able to find any more of the plants, my
companion had to suffer for several days longer; which proves, however, that my
relief from the tormenting pain was directly to be credited to the medical virtue
of the Gollindrinera.</p>

<p>During my lengthened stay among the natives of Australia, I observed that no
black man ever died from the bite of a venomous reptile,—excepting always the
dead-adder, (bothrops)—while a white man seldom escaped death. The remedy
of the blacks is very simple, consisting merely in sucking out the wound, and in
keeping awake the patient for at least twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The
dead adder (bothrops) of Australia is probably the most poisonous reptile. A
black man, if bitten by this snake, will be abandoned to death by his friends, they
being sure that help is out of the question. I witnessed once the death of a
victim of the dead-adder.</p>

<p>I read in an Australian paper, that a white boy, who was bitten in the finger
by a dead-adder, had so much presence of mind, as to chop it off with his pocket-knife.
The finger had afterwards to be regularly amputated, but the boy’s life
was saved.</p>

<h3>On the existence of an Atoll near the west coast of
America, and proof of its elevation.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. HARPER PEASE, OF HONOLULU, H. I.</p>

<p>Having read an interesting paper by Dr. Blake, in a late number of the <i>Proceedings
California Academy</i>, on the proofs of a recent elevation of the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of California, it occurred to me that I had in my note book, information unpublished
on the same subject. As it lies within the field occupied by your
Academy, I furnish it herewith for publication. My information was gathered
from a Journal kept by Lieut. Griswold,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (a young gentleman of scientific taste,
and a close and accurate observer,) during a cruise off the west coast of Mexico,
in search of guano. Among the islands visited, was “Clipperton Rock,” which
is the locality I refer to.</p>

<p>Before giving any extract, I will state what was known of the island.</p>

<p>It is situated in Lat. 10° 17’ N., Long. 109° 19’ W., and was discovered by
Capt. Clipperton, in 1705. He appears to have sighted only the tall volcanic
rock, which stands near the south end of the island, and passed on without learning
of the existence of the island. It appears not to have been noticed again for
more than a century, so that its position, and even its existence was doubted.</p>

<p>The only published account of its having been visited since, are those by Capt.
Benj. Morrell<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and Sir Edward Belcher.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The former called there during a
sealing voyage, in 1825, and gives a meagre account of it in a few lines, remarking,
that “it produces a little shrubbery and some coarse grass, among which, I
think, fresh water might be found by digging. Among the few vegetable productions
of this island, we found a plant resembling sarsaparilla, which badly poisoned
several of the crew who handled it.”</p>

<p>Sir Edward Belcher, during his surveying expedition, wishing to verify the
existence and position of the island, searched and found it. He did not land, but
gives the result of his examination from the mast-head. With other remarks, he
states that “it is a coral lagoon island, three miles long N. and S., and the same
E. and W. There are two entrances, both on the weather side, which at high-water
may be safe, but at the moment we passed, the surf was too heavy and
the reflux showed the rocks bare. On the beach several large trees were observed,
but no living trees were seen.” (May 8, 1839.)</p>

<p>Lieutenant Griswold notes in his journal, as follows: “On the 6th of August,
1861, we lay on our oars, just outside the breakers on the N. E. side. At half
past six we were ashore, shooting in on a high roller, which left us high and dry
upon the beach, with a hole stove in our bow. The beach was covered with
drift wood, and while the crew were collecting it, I started to examine the island.</p>

<p>“Upon every side it is girdled by a broad barrier of coral, about fifteen feet
above the level of the ocean. There is no entrance to the lagoon, neither does it
communicate with the ocean by subterranean passages, as the water inside is
<i>fresh</i> and <i>potable</i>. It is slightly brackish, but will appease thirst. The ‘<span class="smcap">Rock</span>’ is
a ragged pile of volcanic formation, on the south end of the island, gray and
splashed over with the deposit of the birds. It is cracked and split in every
possible direction, here and there shooting into tottering pinnacles. As you
wander through the caverns and clefts, with which it is perforated, there is an
incessant splashing and dropping of water. On the very topmost pinnacle, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
I reached after a hard climb, I found a little basin containing a couple of buckets
full. The caverns were dreary looking places, dark and wet, and echoing to the
hoarse cries of the sea-birds. The rock, on its sides, is rounded and smoothed
by the action of the waves, at some long past time, and in many places ‘<i>the walls
are crusted with coral</i>.’</p>

<p>“The highest pinnacle of the rock is about 120 feet high, and it covers, I should
think, about two acres. It stands on the edge of the lagoon, or rather within it,
being connected with the coral barrier only by a narrow isthmus of coral clinker.
Between this rock and the sea, however, the barrier, instead of being as elsewhere,
a solid platform of coral, is only a heap of fragments, piled in winrows by
the waves, 250 or 300 yards in width. The lagoon is a quiet fresh water pond,
two miles long and about one broad, with a long spit of mud running out into the
middle of it, but elsewhere of a light green color, which seemed to indicate a
considerable depth. Its shores are abrupt, the coral platform in most places projecting
out over water of a considerable depth. I did not find the least sign of
vegetable life upon the island.</p>

<p>“The only plant<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> seen, grew in considerable quantities in the lagoon, which I
pulled out of the water, where it was growing. There is nothing but a coral
platform, coral clinker and coral sand. We found nothing to detain us and left
the island on the afternoon of the day on which we landed.”</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, on his remarks on the geographical distribution of reef-building
corals, states that he could find no evidence of their living on or near the west
coast of America, and consequently discredits the statement made by Sir Edward
Belcher; for after examining a Ms. chart of Clipperton Rock, at the Admiralty
Office, drawn by Sir Edward, came to the conclusion that it was more of the
shape of a crater. The Island is, however, a true Atoll and has been elevated at
least 100 feet.</p>

<p>It must have been closed since 1839, and the freshening of the water has probably
been caused by rain.</p>

<p>We may also add, that it stands within the limits of reef building corals, as
deduced by Mr. Dana, from tables of the temperature of the sea, and consequently
is confirmatory of his opinion.</p>

<p>We might add other facts in support of Mr. Dana’s theory, but from other
parts of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Discussion as to the adaptation of certain semi-tropical
plants to the climate of California.</p>

<hr />

<h2><span class="smcap">Regular Meeting, July 3, 1865.</span></h2>

<p class="center">President in the chair.</p>

<p>Eight members present. Prof. John Torrey, R. Kennicott
W. H. Dall, Horace Mann, and Capt. Wright, visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Donations to the Cabinet: A collection of Rocky Mountain
plants, by Mr. Bolander.</p>

<p>General discussion as to the motions of the Flying-fish.</p>

<p>Remarks by Mr. Kennicott and Dr. Behr upon the relation
of the Esquimaux to the North American Indians. Dr. Behr
stated that the Esquimaux could be considered only as a kind
of Indians, their language being of the same structure, and
their different habits were owing to physical influences. He
further stated, that the Esquimaux lived formerly farther
south. Mr. Kennicott remarked, that from his observations
and information derived from Madam Roshkin and from St.
Zagoshins’ Report, he believed the natives, for some hundreds
of miles up the Kvichpak or Yonkon River, were Esquimaux
rather than Indians.</p>

<p>Dr. Torrey stated, that he found on a trip to the Yosemite
Valley, a plant that he described twenty years ago, and which
he had not since seen in the collections examined by him.
He named the plant, finding it to be a new genus <i>Kelloggia</i>;
the plant is quite common in the valley and vicinity, and belongs
to the family of Rubiaceæ; the aspect of the plant is,
in regard to its ramification, much like that of a <i>Galium</i>,
while its leaves and their arrangement resemble an <i>Epilobium</i>.
It was first discovered by some member of Com. Wilke’s Expedition,
somewhere along or near the Sacramento River.</p>

<p>Dr. Torrey also stated that he found <i>Sarcodes Sanguinea</i>,
(Torrey), the Snow-plant of the Californians, to be apparently
indifferent as to what plant it fixes itself or derives its nourishment
from; he found its fibre penetrating into the root of
a <i>Rumex</i>, and not as has been supposed into the roots of
<i>Sequoia gigantea</i>. He also spoke of the great beauty and
fragrance of the California White Lily, (<i>Lilium Washingtonianum</i>,)
and of its being quite common in the vicinity of the
Yosemite Valley. Its habits are much like that of the common
white lily, (<i>Lilium candidum</i>).</p>

<p>This evening, at 7 o’clock, a magnificent rainbow was observed,
the colors of which were unusually vivid.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>MEASUREMENTS OF THE HEIGHT AND CIRCUMFERENCE OF TWENTY-FIVE
OF THE “BIG TREES,” (<i>SEQUOIA GIGANTEA</i>,) IN CALAVERAS COUNTY,
BY DR. CHARLES T. JACKSON AND MR. JOSEPH B. MEADER,
AUGUST 2<span class="smcap">d</span> AND 3<span class="smcap">d</span>, 1865.</h3>

<p>Instruments made use of:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Sir H. Douglass’ Reflecting Semicircle; (Cary).</li>
<li>2. A Reflecting Level; made by J. H. Temple, of Boston.</li>
<li>3. A common Measuring Tape.</li>
</ul>

<p>The horizontal point was fixed upon each tree, and the angle measured by the
Reflecting Semicircle, and protracted by it.</p>

<p>The circumference of the trees was measured above the swell of the roots,
about six feet, where the stem takes its proper form.</p>

<p>Several measurements, originally made with too high an angle, were taken over
again with a longer base, so as to avoid the error of refraction in the glasses of
the mirrors.</p>

<p>We trust, therefore, that the following measurements will be found to be
correct.</p>

<p>Donations to the Cabinet: Specimen of Chromic Iron,
from Tuolumne County, by Mr. Hanks.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander submitted a paper on the Grasses of Arizona,
with the following remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The following List of Grasses, accompanied by the very judicious and practical
observations of the Corresponding Member of our Natural History Society, Mr.
C. J. Croft, of the 1st Cavalry California Volunteers, was received by mail from
Fort Goodwin, Arizona Territory, some little time since. From the same intelligent
source, we have, from time to time, received many valuable specimens, preserved
with uncommon care, and reaching us in a state quite unusual, even from
localities far more favorably situated. We are very hopeful, we shall shortly be
placed in possession of specimens of the seed of the <i>White Layia Mexicana</i>, for
ornamental culture, as also of a species of native Potato, from the same indefatigable
individual, who has also furnished us with a very interesting account of
numerous species of the Cactus family, of that District.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>The Grasses of Arizona.</h3>

<p class="center">BY C. J. CROFT, U. S. A.</p>

<p>The grasses of this Territory, principally consist of four varieties:</p>

<p>No. 1. (<i>Pleuraphis Jamesii</i>, Torr.,) is the lowland Grama which grows in great
profusion along the valley of the Gila, and constitutes the principal feed for our
animals, which do quite well upon it, moderately worked.</p>

<p>No. 2. (<i>Aristida purpurea</i>, Nutt.) The highland Grama, growing upon the
sand “mesas,” or highlands, seems to differ but little, if any, from that found in
some portions of California.</p>

<p>No. 3. (<i>Muhlenbergia pungeus</i>, Thurb.) Black Grama, or, “Grama China,” as
vulgarly called by the natives, is the most valuable as feed; upon it animals will
fatten. It grows on the highlands in sandy arid soil. I have never met any of
this variety in the valley of the Colorado, and but very little in the territory of
New Mexico. At this post we have had as many as 700 animals, and the scarcity
of forage required us to herd our stock upon this grass during the winter. We
were often obliged to make rapid and distant marches in pursuit of Indians, over
a country almost impassable, yet our horses stood it well, fed only upon this grass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Our cavalry here had no grain during the entire winter. This Grama, like the
other species, grows in bunches several feet apart, and the lower stalks are green
during the winter season.</p>

<p>No. 4. (<i>Sporobolus airoides</i>, Trin.) This grows in the valleys. A great portion
of the Gila Valley is covered with it. Animals eat it readily when green; it is
however a powerful diuretic. As a winter grass it is of no account.</p>

<p>Besides these four enumerated grasses, the letter contained three others from
the same locality:</p>

<p>1. <i>Panicum capillare</i>, L.</p>

<p>2. <i>Tricuspis pulchella</i>, Kunth.</p>

<p>3. <i>A Poa</i>, much of the habitat of <i>Poa sudetica</i>. Vivid green; leaves plane,
rather large; spikelets four-flowered, oval; lower glume one, and the upper three
nerved; lower palea distinctly three-nerved, scabrous on the Red nerve. The
nerves of the glumes, as well as of the lower palea, are of a vivid green color,
and exceedingly prominent. The whole aspect of the plant sent, would rather
suggest that it is not indigenous to that section of the country.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Note on the abundance of Iron Ore in Northern Arizona.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>In 1863 I observed an iron formation of considerable extent and interest upon
and near the William’s Fork of the Colorado, near its mouth. The ore is chiefly
the micaceous variety of Hematite, or “specular iron,” and occurs in thick beds
and in thin sheets, in a ferruginous limestone or dolomite, evidently metamorphic,
and tilted up at a high angle.</p>

<p>It forms a belt of peculiar appearance, that may be traced by the eye for miles
across the country, in a direction a few degrees south of west. This rock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
iron ore is inter-stratified with chloritic and talcose slates and granite, and the
series also bears copper ores and gold.</p>

<p>From the collections made by Lieut. Whipple’s party, in 1853, in the mountains
north, it would appear, that similar rocks exist in the Cerbat and Aquarius
Mountains, the extreme geological antiquity of which, was commented on by me
in the Pacific R. R. Reports, Vol. III, p. 59. It is possible that this ferriferous
formation is connected with the extensive iron formation of the coast of Mexico,
south of Acapulco, described by Mr. Manross, (Am. Journ. Sci., XXXIX, 358,)
and it may be of pre-Silurian date.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island, 10-20 fm., <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>The appearance of this northern genus among the Mopaliæ and Ischnochitons
is very remarkable; as is the character of the mantle-margin.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Nacella</span>, Schumacher.</h4>

<h5><i>Nacella (? palleacea, var.) triangularis</i>, Cpr. State Coll. No. 416<i>c</i>.</h5>

<p>N. t. “<i>N. palleacea</i>” simili, sed multo minus elongatâ; apice elato, marginibus
rectangulatim divergentibus; albidâ, maculis fuscis perpaucis ornatâ; striulis
subobsoletis.</p>

<p>Long. 0·28, lat. 0·12, alt. 0·18, div. 90°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Monterey, 4 dredged dead, <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>Probably a distinct species. The solitary shell sent by Dr. Cooper is shaped
like a right-angled triangle, with five large brown spots near the base.</p>

<h5><i>? Nacella subspiralis</i>, Cpr.? n. s. State Collection, 416b.</h5>

<p>? N. t. parvâ, carneâ, lævi, tenuissimâ; vertice “<i>Emarginulæ</i>” simulante,
subspirali, sed apice patelloideo, adunco; t. adultâ valde elevatâ; margine laterali
antico subrecto, apice projiciente, valde remoto; postico maxime fornicato;
aperturæ margine antice et postice prolongato.</p>

<p>Long. 0·26, lat. 0·19, alt. 0·20, div. 80°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island, 10-20 fm., 4 dead, <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>This may be the young of the long-lost <i>Patella calyptra</i>, Mart. It may be
a <i>Scutellina</i>. Even the genus cannot be predicated from the shell alone.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Acmæa</span>, Eschholtz.</h4>

<h5><i>Acmæa (? pileolus, var.) rosacea</i>, Cpr.</h5>

<p>A. t. parvâ, conicâ, tenui, lævi; t. jun. pallide rosaceâ, elegantissime maculis
albis et fuscis subradiatim sparsis; t. adulta strigis fusco-rosaceis et albidis
pictâ; apice elevato, parum antico; intus rosaceo.</p>

<p>Long. 0·20, lat. 0·16, alt. 0·08, div. 100°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Diego, 1 sp. jun. (<i>Palmer</i>): Monterey, 1 dead sp. <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>The absence of striæ, very thin texture, and regularly conical growth, distinguish
this shell from <i>A. patina</i>, a rare variety of which has a pinkish tinge.
Specimens in Mus. Cuming are marked “<i>pileolus</i>, Midd.,” but do not accord
with the diagnosis. It is almost exactly like Herm<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> specimens of <i>A. virginea</i>.
Col. Jewett’s similar shells, marked “Panama,” were perhaps West Indian.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Scurria</span> (?), Gray.</h4>

<h5><i>Scurria (?) funiculata</i>, Cpr. (?) n. s. State Collection, No. 466<i>d</i>.</h5>

<p>? Sc. t. parvâ, albidâ, regulariter conicâ, apice acuto, elevato, parum antrorsum

haud conspicuo.</p>

<p>Long. 0·50, lat. 0·38, alt. 0·26, div. 80°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Monterey, 6 dredged dead, <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>So different from the most strongly marked young specimens of <i>Sc. mitra</i>
that I presume it to be distinct. The genus depends on the animal, which has
not yet been seen.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Puncturella</span>, Lowe.</h4>

<h5><i>Puncturella Cooperi</i>, Cpr. n. s. State Collection No. 1029.</h5>

<p>P. t. “<i>P. galeatæ</i>,” fere exacte simulante; sed laminâ internâ solidâ, planatâ,
haud antice sinuatâ, haud suffultâ.</p>

<p>Long. 0·30, lat. 0·21, alt. 0·24, div. 70°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Catalina Island, not rare, 40 to 20 fms., <i>Cooper</i>, alive.</p>

<p>Outside like <i>P. noachina</i>; but with the lamina like <i>P. cucullata</i>, without eye-holes.
The latter species is extremely variable in sculpture, but never so fine
as this; and the shape is less conical.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Gibbula</span>, Leach.</h4>

<h5><i>Gibbula optabilis</i>, Cpr. n. s.</h5>

<p>G. t. parvâ, pulcherrimâ, subconicâ; lurida, fusco-purpureo maculatâ; anfr.
v. subquadratis, suturis distinctis; carinis principalibus in spirâ ii., aliâ intercalante;

punctatis; lirâ posticâ subobsolete suturam attingente; aliis minoribus intercalantibus;
interstitiis ubique tenerrime et creberrime decussatis; basi subtumente,
ad carinam peripherialem fere rectangulato; aperturâ subquadratâ,
columellâ parum arcuata; umbilico magno, infundibuliformi, angulato; liris
ii. intus spiraliter ascendentibus.</p>

<p>Long. 0·19, long. spir. 0·10, lat. 0·19, div. 80°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Pedro, <i>Palmer</i>, one specimen.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Calliostoma</span>, Swainson.</h4>

<p>The names <i>Calliostoma</i> and <i>Ziziphinus</i> having been published in the same
year, I have no hesitation in preferring the generic to the specific.</p>

<h5><i>Calliostoma supragranosum</i>, Cpr. n. s.</h5>

<p>C. t. parvâ; anfr. v. tumentibus; liris acutis cincta, quarum mediæ læves,
posticæ granosæ, basales ix. minores.</p>

<p>The single specimen sent differs as above from the young of the next species.</p>

<h5><i>Calliostoma gemmulatum</i>, Cpr. Br. Assoc. Rep. 1863, pp. 612, 653.</h5>

<p>Syn. <i>C. formosum</i>, Cpr. Proc. Cal. Ac. 1864, 155: non Forbes.</p>

<p>While the sheets of the Report were passing through the press, it was found
that the name had been preoccupied by Forbes. As it happened the Californian
sheet was being printed simultaneously, and there was no time to make the
alteration.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Ethalia</span>, Adams.</h4>

<h5><i>Ethalia supravallata</i>, Cpr. n. s.</h5>

<p>E. t. parvâ, albidâ, nitente, subdiaphanâ, planatâ; anfr. nucl. ii. et dimidio,
lævis, diaphanis; norm. uno et dimidio, rotundatis; postice carinâ valde extante,
et fossâ concavâ contiguâ suturam tenus, supra spiram vix planatam ascendente;
in medio basis rotundatæ carinâ alterâ plus minusve extante; inter eas, circa
peripheriam, lirulis radiantibus minimis, haud expressis, sub lente vix conspicuis;
regione umbilicari parum concavo; aperturâ circulari; labro à carinis angulato;
columellâ, valde callosâ, porrecta; callositate pyriformi regionem umbilicarem
circumambiente.</p>

<p>Long. 0·03, long, spir. 0. (?) lat. 0·45, div. 180°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Diego, <i>Cooper</i>, shell-washings.</p>

<p>Typical among the Vitrinelloid <i>Ethaliæ</i> described in Maz. Cat., Nos. 310,
318. Remarkable for the small number of turns in the mature shell as compared
with the nucleus.</p>

<h5><i>Ethalia var. invallata</i>, Cpr.</h5>

<p>E. t. “<i>E. supravallatæ</i>,” aliter exacte simili; sed vallo spirali omnino carente;
basi angulatâ, haud carinatâ.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Diego, shell-washings, <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>These shells would certainly have been regarded as distinct, but for one specimen
which began smoothly, yet after a fracture suddenly commenced a (not
prominent) keel: an instructive lesson on variations in sculpture.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Galerus</span>, Humphreys.</h4>

<h5><i>Galerus contortus</i>, Cpr. n. s. State Collection, No. 369.</h5>

<p>G. t. parvâ, tenui, albidâ; vertice nucleoso planato, extante, minimo, anfr.
uno et dimidio planorbi-formibus, apice conspicuo; dein conoideâ, elevata, solute
spirali, suturis impressis; superficie rudi, laminis incrementi interdum conspicuis;
laminâ internâ.</p>

<p>Long. 0·26, lat. 0·24, alt. 0·15, div. 80°.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Monterey, 20-40 fm.; Santa Barbara, 16-20 fm.; Catalina Island,
30-40 fm.; <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>The vertex stands out like a tiny Planorbis, and is more minute than in any
species I have examined.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Cæcum</span>, Fleming.</h4>

<p>Has the aspect, but not the sculpture, of an Elephantulum.</p>

<h5><i>Cœcum Cooperi</i>, Cpr. n. s. State Collection, No. 667a.</h5>

<p>C. (<i>Anellum</i>) t. parvâ, satis tereti, albâ; annulis crebris acutioribus, angustis,

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Turritella</span>, Lamarck.</h4>

<h5><i>Turritella Cooperi</i>, Cpr. n. s. State Collection, No. 564.</h5>

<p>T. t. valde tereti, tenuiore, cinereâ, rufofusco tinctâ; anf. plurimis, angustis,

<p>Long. 1·80, long. spir. 1·50, lat. 0·45.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> San Pedro, 60; San Diego, 16 dead on beach; Santa Barbara, 4 dead,
in 16-20 fms. <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>As I have seen no complete list of the very numerous fossil species of this
genus, it appears allowable, rather than risk a synonym, to name this graceful
shell after its discoverer.</p>

<h4>Genus? <span class="smcap">Mesalia</span>, Gray.</h4>

<h5><i>? Mesalia tenuisculpta</i>, Cpr. n. s. State Collection, No. 666 <i>a</i>.</h5>

<p>? M. t. tenui, regulariter turritâ, fusco-cinereâ; anfr. nucl. lævibus, normalibus,

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Diego, 10 fm.; Sta. Barbara, 20 fm.; <i>Cooper</i>.</p>

<p>The fortunate discovery of some perfect young specimens displays a nucleus
so like <i>Odostomia</i> that, despite the resemblance of the shell to <i>Fossarus</i>, which
has a tuberoid nucleus, it most probably belongs to <i>Pyramidellidæ</i>.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Rissoina</span>, D’Orbigny.</h4>

<p><i>Hab.</i> S. Diego; 25 dredged in shoal water. <i>Cooper.</i></p>

<p>Differs from the figure of <i>Ch. tenuicula</i> (which represents a shell with more
numerous ribs than the diagnosis) in its more distant ribs with broader interstices;
closer and deeper spiral sculpture; impressed sutures; and especially by
the elegant murication of the tops of the ribs, with projecting, curved lines
between. This is best seen in the young shells, when the ribs are distinct over
the base.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Eulima</span>, Risso.</h4>

with <i>Euryta</i>, <i>Truncaria</i>, <i>Metula</i>, and <i>Daphnella</i>.</p>

<h4>Genus <span class="smcap">Anachis</span>, H. &amp; A. Adams.</h4>

<p>Besides the above species, which were entirely new to science, the fresh and
perfect specimens collected by Dr. Cooper, on the Survey, from authentic localities
have enabled me to make out and complete the diagnoses of many species
first found indeed by other naturalists, but in such poor condition, or with
such uncertainty of habitat, that it would have been unsafe to have ventured
on their description.</p>

<h3>Remarks on California Trees.</h3>

<p class="center">BY HENRY N. BOLANDER.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Localities given with two !! I have not visited myself. I would also further
remark that I am by no means sure of having correctly determined the two oaks—<i>Quercus
Douglasii</i> and <i>Garryana</i>.</p>

<p>It may not be altogether amiss to offer some observations on the distribution
and value, as specimens, of some of our trees which I have met with on my
various trips over a portion of this State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<h4>1. <i>Pinus Sabiniana</i>, Dougl. (Digger Pine.)</h4>

<p>Invariably disposed over south-hillsides of the interior, occupying the driest
expositions—Mount Diablo! Russian River Valley! Geysers! Auburn and
Forest Hill! San José Valley! Near Mission San Antonio!! Mountains east
of San Diego!!</p>

<p>As to its value there are a great many contradictory assertions made by
farmers; some assert it yields an excellent wood for yokes and similar objects,
while others denounce it as entirely useless.</p>

<h4>2. <i>Pinus Lambertiana</i>, Dougl. (Sugar Pine.)</h4>

<p>Pine Mountains near Geysers! Near Cloverdale! Forest Hill! Mountains
east of San Diego!! Generally with <i>Pinus ponderosa</i> in groves, occupying the
damper localities.</p>

<h4>3. <i>Pinus ponderosa</i>, Dougl. (Yellow Pine.)</h4>

<p>Russian River Valley! south of Clear Lake! Geysers! Auburn and Forest
Hill! San José Valley! Blue Mountains!! (Mr. Dunn) Rocky Mountains!!
New Mexico!!</p>

<h4>4. <i>Pinus insignis</i>. Dougl. (Monterey Pine.)</h4>

<p>Monterey! Carmelo Valley!</p>

<p>This species covers many thousand acres of land near and by Monterey and
Carmelo, forming quite an extensive forest along the coast between these two
places. Height, sixty to one hundred feet, and one to three feet diameter; outline
very irregular, consisting often of only a few rigid spreading branches; foliage
dense and of a vivid green color; cones persistent, often from ten to nineteen
whorls; bark very thick and rimose. Wood extremely resinous and
rather coarse-grained; excellent for street planks, bridges, and floors. At present
it is no more in the market as lumber; the good timber has been all cut,
and the saw-mill removed.</p>

<p>Considering that there is, besides this species, only <i>Pinus muricata</i> growing
in that forest, which could not be confounded with the species in question—it
is certainly most singular to meet with so many synonyms for it. <i>Pinus radiata</i>,
Don.; <i>Pinus Sinclairii</i> and <i>Pinus tuberculata</i>, provided this last should
not prove to be a good species. It is the more astonishing since trees and cones
are of great conformity throughout the entire forest.</p>

<h4>5. <i>Pinus tuberculata</i>, Don.</h4>

<p>Santa Cruz! Ukiah! Oakland hills! Forest Hill! Eureka!!</p>

<p>In all these localities, it is a small tree, from twenty to thirty feet high, and
from six to fourteen inches in diameter. It retains its lowest branches, which
spread generally very much, often horizontally. The foliage seems to me less
dense and less vivid-green, than that of the preceding. Young trees raised
here, side by side, show the same differential characters. The cones from all
these different localities are very uniform, and differ essentially from those of
<i>Pinus insignis</i> at Monterey. The seeds, however, resemble each other very
much. Both species grow near the coast, but on different soil. <i>Pinus insignis</i>,
on a soil produced by the disintegration of a bituminous slate and granite;
<i>Pinus tuberculata</i>, in all the above-mentioned localities, on a soil derived from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
metamorphosed sandstone. Should these two species be definitely united, after
a thorough investigation, they would afford a most striking example of the influence
of a different soil. It is certainly singular to find such a well-characterized
form restricted to one locality only. This fact, however, would not stand isolated
with us here; <i>Abies bracteata</i>, we find similarly confined to one locality
only in California. Isolation is more or less a characteristic feature with all
our trees, and there is probably no country where the influences of soil, climate,
and exposition are so well and abruptly marked and unmistakably defined.</p>

<h4>6. <i>Pinus muricata</i>, Don.</h4>

<p>Monterey! Mendocino City!</p>

<p>In a moist depression at Monterey, I found a small group of this species,
averaging about fifteen feet in height, and five to six inches in diameter. Bark
reddish and nearly smooth; branches almost at a right angle with the main
axis and generally from five to seven in a whorl; leaves of a darker vivid green,
and more succulent and longer, than those of <i>Pinus insignis</i>, of which there
were trees of the same size by the side of it; cones from three to seven, in a
whorl very much aggregated and clustered. I counted seventeen whorls on a
tree fifteen feet high. The lower portion of the trunk was clad with dead leaves.</p>

<p>At the same distance (about two miles) from the ocean, and scarcely a mile
from the above-mentioned depression, I found another group (mixed with
<i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i>) in a deeper but drier locality. Here the tree was altogether
of a different aspect, inferior in all its parts. This very transition suggested
strongly, that this pine and the one previously seen on the plains near
Mendocino City, on a similar soil, might be of the same species.</p>

<p>Near Mendocino City, on the so-called plains, I found in great abundance a
small pine tree, which I refer for the present to this species.</p>

<p>Height, five to twenty feet, but the greater number averaged only from five
to fifteen feet. Only one tree which I noticed which was fifty-five inches in
circumference, and twenty to twenty-five feet in height. It had a flattish top
with the branches very much imbricated and so completely covered with cones,
that it was really difficult to discover its foliage. But this tree was very exceptional,
compared with the mass of little trees covering the plains. These had
in general upright branches with numerous and slender branchlets; leaves
shorter, denser, and of a darker green than <i>Pinus contorta</i>? which grows with
it and is a larger tree altogether; bark reddish, very thin, exhaling a strong
resinous odor, and but slightly rimose; cones two to four inches long (curved
when long) and scarcely an inch thick, mostly in pairs, but sometimes in threes,
reflexed. I counted fifteen sets of cones on a tree fifteen feet high.</p>

<h4>7. <i>Pinus contorta</i>, Dougl.?</h4>

<p>Head of Tomales Bay! Mendocino City!</p>

<p>Its manner of growth resembles that of <i>Pinus insignis</i> very much. It attains
the same height, has the same irregular spreading branches, the same thick
rimose bark and very resinous wood. The leaves are invariably in pairs and
slightly silvery on the lower surface. The cones are scarcely two inches long
with mostly reflex pedicles (umbo) on the slightly gibbous side and persistent
for a great number of years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>From the River Albin to Mendocino City, it grows quite near the coast on a
fertile and undulating plain, gently descending towards the ocean. At Mendocino
City I found it to extend all over the plains about eight miles eastward.</p>

<p>Whether this species is identical with <i>Pinus contorta</i> or not I am unable to
decide. Observations made by Mr. Geo. Wm. Dunn, on his recent travels
through the Blue and Siskiyou mountains, have rather a tendency to show that
<i>Pinus contorta</i> is altogether a different tree. I can state, however, most positively
that this species cannot be confounded with <i>Pinus muricata</i>. Both
species are two-leaved, but in every other respect they differ widely. The
object of these remarks is only to point out the different species, met in my
travels, and not to decide which name should have precedence. Murray’s discussion
on the distribution of our Pines, in his “Notes on California Trees,” has
not “struck” me as being so very correct. Endlicher, in his Synopsis Coniferarum,
makes <i>Pinus muricata</i> a Taeda, which is also incorrect; it is a true
Pinaster. It remains to decide only, whether the species at Mendocino City is
<i>P. contorta</i>, or <i>P. Murrayana</i>, Balf.</p>

<h4>8. <i>Libocedrus decurrens</i>, Torr. (California White Cedar.)</h4>

<p>Forest Hill!
(forming quite a large woods there). Rancheria Creek! Mendocino County.
East of Salinas River, Monterey County. Dr. Canfield. East of San Diego!!</p>

<p>On the banks of Rancheria Creek, in the south-western part of Mendocino
County, I found a small colony of this handsome tree. The largest were about
forty to sixty feet high and two to three feet in diameter. Judging from the
young after-growth, the tree seems likely to spread. I was informed that this
is the only place in the county where it is to be found. In the latter part of
September (1865) the tree had its aments strongly developed. Cones decidedly
pendulous.</p>

<h4>9. <i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i>, Hartw. (Monterey Cypress.)</h4>

<p>Monterey! Tamal
Pais (2,700 feet)! Mendocino City! and south-east of Clear Lake!</p>

<p>This species seems to be extremely variable. At Monterey, about two miles
from the coast, I saw, upon exposed granite rocks, but slightly disintegrated,
specimens only six inches high, bearing perfect cones. Going westward, at the
same distance from the ocean, I found specimens in a depression associated with
<i>Pinus muricata</i>, from ten to fifteen feet high, full with cones; and extending
my walk to Cypress Point, a distance of three to four miles, I was surprised to
find a large grove of this species, containing mostly large trees of great beauty
and perfection. The average height may be from forty to sixty feet, and as they
were (right at the point) almost all alike in thickness, I measured but three,
finding their circumference to be one hundred and nineteen, one hundred and
four, and one hundred and twenty inches, about four feet above the ground.
At this point these trees are almost daily enveloped in a dense fog. Their
branches are very densely imbricated and depressed, retaining the moisture to
such an extent that the thick clusters of cones are quite mouldy. Between the
cones and little dense branchlets settles a great deal of rubbish, which is almost
dripping wet. It is undoubtedly owing to this very fact that so many seeds of
this species, collected there, prove abortive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing so great a variation at Monterey, I do not hesitate to refer all specimens,
seen at the other localities mentioned above, to this species at present.</p>

<p>On the plain near Mendocino City, that species exhibited about the same
gradations, although not so strikingly as at Monterey.</p>

<h4>10. <i>Torreya Californica</i>, Torr. (California Nutmeg.)</h4>

<p>Paper Mill! Marin
County. Ukiah! Mendocino City! Forest Hill!</p>

<p>Generally dispersed, only at Ukiah I found quite a group of this species.
Wood valuable.</p>

<h4>11. <i>Taxus brevifolia</i>, Nutt. (California Yew-Tree.)</h4>

<p>Devil’s Cañon, near
Forest Hill! A handsome tree, twenty to thirty feet high, with extremely
slender and drooping branches. Dispersed but plenty.</p>

<p>Wood valuable.</p>

<h4>12. <i>Quercus agrifolia</i>, Nées. (Live Oak.)</h4>

<p>Oakland! Banks of Sacramento
River! Clear Lake! Russian River Valley! Anderson Valley! Monterey!</p>

<p>Foliage extremely variable. On river banks and in expositions close to the
coast, where it is almost daily enveloped in fogs, this species exhibits quite a
uniformity; the figure of <i>Quercus oxyadenia</i> in Sitgreaves’ Report represents
this form of it very well. In the valleys of the interior the shape of the leaves
of one and the same tree is very different. Some have entire margins, while
others have them pretty deeply dentated, often one side is entire and the other
dentate. Some trees occur of which the young shoots have the leaves “coarsely
sinuate-toothed, or obliquely sinuate-toothed; teeth very sharply acute with a
broad base, cuspidate-awned,” and thus agree with Dr. Kellogg’s <i>Quercus
Morehus</i>—while the older branches have much smaller and entire leaves. In
Anderson Valley I saw several trees whose entire foliage agrees admirably with
Dr. Kellogg’s. Had I not seen that tree on the shore of Borax Lake exhibiting
both forms, I should be inclined to call it a good species. The cups of the
acorns of these trees have the scales long and loosely imbricated, and the acorn
is almost entirely immerged; but this is also the case with those of some trees
that have a far different foliage. Thus far I have not been able to find good,
distinctive, reliable characters. There are transitions in all parts, even on the
same tree. As the tree has the habit of growing in groups, one might suppose
that trees of one group, at least, should show a uniformity in botanical characters;
this is not so: just the very extremes may be found in one and the same
group. This phenomenon I observed throughout the whole length of Anderson
Valley, a distance of some eighteen miles. On dry gravelly hillsides in the
interior this tree presents still another form: <i>Quercus Wislizeni</i>, Englm.</p>

<p>The acorns ripen annually and differ also essentially in shape and size. Soil,
climate, and exposition, offer in this case no satisfactory explanation for so great
a variation in one species. Should it not be attributed to intrinsic peculiarities?</p>

<h4>13. <i>Quercus Garryana</i>, Hook. (White Oak.)</h4>

<p>On dry easterly hillsides and
in valleys on a poor buff-colored clay. Santa Rosa Valley! Clear Lake! Searsville!
Anderson Valley! San José Valley!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Exposition and soil agree in all these localities.</p>

<p>The bark of this tree is rather thin, whitish, and less coarsely rimose than
any other of the Californian oaks. It is always a flat-topped, middle-sized tree,
apparently of a very slow, almost stunted, growth. The whitish bark of trunk
and branches, the glaucous foliage, and the light-green color of the acorns,
which it yields, however, quite sparingly, give this tree, compared with other
oaks especially, quite a pale and hoary appearance.</p>

<p>Farmers consider the fine-grained wood of this oak very valuable for many
farming implements. It ranks highest among our oaks.</p>

<h4>14. <i>Quercus Douglasii</i>, Hook. (Pale Oak.)</h4>

<p>Anderson Valley!</p>

<p>The general aspect and habit of this tree resembles very much that of <i>Quercus
lobata</i>, with which it grows in the low, flat portions of Anderson Valley.
Its branchlets, however, are short, rigid, and erect, while those of <i>Qu. lobata</i>
are mostly drooping. In fall, when laden with acorns, it presents a very striking
difference by having its rather pale acorns densely aggregated and clustered
at the extremities of the branchlets, resting, as it were, on the dark-green
leaves. At a distance it may be mistaken for a full-bearing apple tree. It
increases rapidly in number in Anderson Valley from south to north, outnumbering
almost every other oak at the lower end of the valley. Its wood ranks
next to that of <i>Quercus Douglasii</i>.</p>

<h4>15. <i>Quercus lobata</i>, Nées. (Burr-Oak.)</h4>

<p>The most common and largest oak in all the valleys of the interior of California.
Thus far, I never found it on a hillside. It is this mighty oak, with
its peculiar, gracefully-drooping branchlets, that gives character to the landscape
of the Californian valleys. It is especially noted for its very long acorns;
but they do not always attain that large size, and are never so conspicuously
arranged as those of <i>Qu. Garryana</i>; they are usually in pairs. It may also
be stated that this tree forms, on an average, about the longest trunk of Californian
foliaceous trees. The acorns of this species form a principal part of
the food of the Indians. On the Coast Range they seem to give, however,
preference to those of <i>Quercus Sonomensis</i>. The wood ranks next to that of
the preceding species.</p>

<p>These above-mentioned three species of oaks, belonging to the section of
white oaks, are surely distinct. I met with no transitions thus far. They may
be distinguished at a distance; every farmer distinguishes them, for there is
quite a difference in the quality of the wood.</p>

<h4>16. <i>Quercus Sonomensis</i>, Benth. (Black Oak.)</h4>

<p>San Diego!! Anderson Valley! Auburn!</p>

<p>Eastern and northern hillsides in the Coast Ranges. It also occupies the
more easterly-situated flats, among the redwoods, wherever they are too dry for
redwood. Very seldom it is found in the valley; and when found, it occupies
that portion of it which is adjacent to the hillsides, where there is generally a
gravelly soil. It is always a middle-sized tree, having mostly numerous erect
branches arranged like those of <i>Acer saccharinum</i>. In fall it sheds its leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
which become buff-colored, before any other of our deciduous oaks. The wood
of this tree is of a poor quality; used for fuel only.</p>

<h4>17. <i>Quercus chrysolepis</i>, Liebm. (Drooping Live Oak.)</h4>

<p>The most rare of all our oaks; it bears acorns but seldom, and even then
very sparingly. I have not been able to satisfy myself whether they are biannual
or not, but I am rather inclined to believe they are. Northern slopes
near Cloverdale! in Anderson Valley! and near Forest Hill! Tree 30-40 feet
high, with a rather smooth whitish bark, and mostly long, slender, drooping
branches; evergreen. Of the quality of its wood I could not learn anything
from settlers. The tree being rare, and occupying always moist slopes along
gulches, it is not often cut down.</p>

<h4>18. <i>Quercus densiflora</i>, Hook. (Chestnut Oak.)</h4>

<p>Along the Coast Range, associated with the redwood, increasing northwards;
from Santa Cruz to Mendocino City, at least, it occurs only in or close by the
redwoods. This tree attains rather a large height in dense woods, and is then
but sparingly branched. Leaves and acorns very considerable. Its wood is
absolutely useless; it is very coarse grained, and like the redwood wet like a
sponge when cut; it is extremely perishable. At Mendocino City log-men call
it Water Oak.</p>

<h4>19. <i>Castanea chrysophylla</i>, Dougl. (Chestnut.)</h4>

<p>On the Oakland hills this species is but 3-6 feet high; blooms about the
fourth of July, like the Eastern <i>Castanea vesca</i>, and bears perfect fruit. On the
so-called plains at Mendocino City, however, it is a large tree, averaging from
50-125 feet in height, and 2-3 feet in diameter. Those trees were completely
covered with blossoms on the twenty-third of September, 1865; settlers say
they never found its fruit. Here, on the Oakland hills, it grows only on the
outcropping of a white friable slate, destitute of all vegetable remains; at the
Mendocino plains it is found to grow on a cemented gravel, upon which the
water rests for some months after the rainy season. The supply of an aerial
moisture during the dry season is in favor of the Oakland hills, judging by the
lichenose vegetation of the two localities.</p>

<h4>20. <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>, Endl. (Redwood.)</h4>

<p>This mighty tree belongs exclusively to the foggy regions of the Coast
Ranges and the underlying metamorphic sandstone, for wherever either of these
conditions is wanting, this tree does not exist. From the northern boundary
line of the State down to the head of Tomales Bay it forms a continual forest,
increasing in width northward. At Tomales Bay the chain is interrupted by a
small bed of lime-rock. The interruption extending from the lower foot-hills of
Tamalpais down to Belmont, is undoubtedly owing to the lowness of the hills.
A connecting link is found, however, on the Oakland hills. That grove of redwoods,
now almost entirely destroyed, affords the strongest evidences of the
dependency of that species on the prevalence of heavy mists. From Belmont
to a few miles below Santa Cruz is another narrow continuous chain, occupying
mainly the leesides of the most western ranges and the deeper gulches eastward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
From near the mouth of Salinas River to the head of Carmelo Valley,
another long interruption is caused by a bituminous slate. The absence of
redwood in this long interval can hardly be ascribed to any other cause, for it
is known that Monterey and the adjacent regions are subject to heavier fogs
than Santa Cruz. <i>Pinus insignis</i> and <i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i> occupy here those
portions naturally belonging to the redwood and <i>Tsuga Douglasii</i>. Further
south, from the head of Carmelo Valley to San Luis Obispo, the most southern
limit, redwood occurs but sparingly, forming nowhere extensive groves. Associated
with the redwood we find <i>Tsuga Douglasii</i>, a tree of a wide range,
<i>Torreya Californica</i>, <i>Arbutus Menziesii</i>, <i>Quercus densiflora</i>, and in Mendocino
County <i>Abies grandis</i> Dougl. There are also some shrubs and herbaceous
plants truly characteristic to them, the shrubs increasing as underwood northward,
belong mostly to the Ericaceous family. It is a noteworthy fact that the
arborescent growth of the leeside of the first range of hills generally consists,
almost exclusively, of <i>Tsuga Douglasii</i>, and that this tree forms the outskirt
east and particularly westward. In Mendocino County <i>Abies grandis</i> unites
with it for the same cause; there both trees form a dense belt, facing the ocean,
and are encroaching fast on the redwood. In fact, the western portion of those
redwoods show this encroachment most strikingly by a total absence of young
redwood, and a dense, almost impenetrable, undergrowth of the two-mentioned
species. The order of things is, however, reversed wherever the redwood has
been cut. Its roots are imperishable, and as soon as the tree is cut they sprout
and cover the soil rapidly to the exclusion of every other species—none being
of so rapid a growth. The indestructibility of the roots prevents the clearing
of such land; even large trunks cut down cover themselves, within two or three
years, so completely with sprouts that they are hardly seen. The entire after
growth now found on the Oakland hills, is owing solely to the indestructibility
of its roots and stumps. The tenacity of life in this species, which is rather of
rare occurrence in coniferous trees, shows itself also in the resistance it offers to
fire, so frequent in those woods. Trees that have been bereft completely of
their branches by fire, covered themselves in a few years entirely with young
sprouts, giving the trunks the appearance of a pillar, or remind one of those
old trunks covered with <i>Rhus toxicodendron</i> in the East. Fire is destructive to
the young trees only; after they have obtained a thickness of two or three feet
they are not liable to perish.</p>

<p>Another great beneficial feature in this species is the great power it possesses
in condensing fogs and mists. A heavy fog is always turned into a rain, wetting
the soil and supplying springs with water during the dry season. Springs
in and near the redwoods are never in want of a good supply of water, and
crops on the Coast Ranges are not liable to fail. The year of 1864 has proved
my assertion beyond doubt; this fact is generally known—a great deal of
land has been taken up since. It is my firm conviction that if the redwoods
are destroyed—and they necessarily will be, if not protected by a wise action of
our Government—California will become a desert, in the true sense of the word.
In their safety depends the future welfare of the State; they are our safeguard.
It remains to be seen whether we shall be benefited or not by the horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
experience such countries as Asia Minor, Greece, Spain, and France have made,
by having barbarously destroyed their woods and forests. But with us here it
is even of a more serious nature; wise governments would be able to replace
them in those countries, but no power on earth can restore the woods of California
when once completely destroyed!</p>

<h3>Notice of a peculiar Astringent Gum or Coloring Substance
in the Cones of the Sequoia gigantea.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>I am not aware that any notice has yet been taken by scientific chemists of
a peculiar substance, apparently a gum, which accompanies the seeds of the
great trees, and may be shaken out of the dried cones. About twenty cones
yielded me an ounce of the material. It does not adhere to either the seeds or
the cone, but appears to have shrunk from both in drying. It falls out in loose
broken grains with brilliant conchoidal fractured surfaces, and looks a little
like dried blood. The color is purplish-red, nearly black by reflected light, and
a brilliant carmine-red by transmitted.</p>

<p>The taste is strongly astringent, and suggests tannin; it is somewhat bitter,
and is similar also to that of very strong black tea. It softens and becomes
gummy between the teeth. It dissolves completely in water and in ordinary
alcohol, giving a brilliant claret-colored solution which gradually darkens by
exposure to the air. The addition of carbonate of soda darkens the solution
and lime-water turns it black, giving a black scaly precipitate. Dilute sulphuric
acid reddens the solution and causes a red precipitate.</p>

<p>It is in many respects similar to the <i>kino</i> of the shops, but has a brighter
colored powder and streaks. The kino that I have seen has a brownish-red
streak; this substance gives a purplish-red.</p>

<p>The reactions with alkalies and acids in respect to color are similar to those
of green redwood boards, which may be stained as dark as rosewood by alkalies
and red by acids.</p>

<p>This substance may be found to have some peculiar value in pharmacy, or as
a coloring matter for tinctures or wine. I hope that this notice will induce a
thorough investigation of its nature and properties. If it proves to be new, I
suggest that it shall be known as <i>Sequonin</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Memorial Sketch of Thomas Bridges, Esq., F.L.S., F.Z.S., and
Member of the Cala. Acad. Sci.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. H. DALL, ACTING DIRECTOR SCI. CORPS, W. U. T. EX.</p>

<p>Mr. Bridges was born at Lilly in Hertfordshire, England, on the twenty-second
of May, 1807.</p>

<p>At an early age he became interested in Natural History, and when about
nineteen or twenty—having previously studied for some three years under Sir
William Hooker, at Kew Gardens—he sailed for Valparaiso. He remained
here or passed the time in some of the adjoining provinces, from 1827 to 1844,
when he returned to England on a short visit. On again reaching South
America, he undertook the explorations in Bolivia, so well known to naturalists,
through their magnificent results. During the course of this journey, in June,
1845, he discovered and obtained seeds of the great South American Water
Lily, the <i>Victoria Regia</i>, Lindley. Although the plant had previously been
detected, to Mr. Bridges belonged the honor of first introducing it into the
old world, by transporting seeds which subsequently germinated at Kew.</p>

<p>In 1846, he returned to England, where for many months he was prostrated
by severe illness contracted in his arduous explorations.</p>

<p>In 1847, he was married to Miss Mary Benson, of Bristol, England, a niece
of the eminent collector, the late Hugh Cuming. Soon after he proceeded
again to Valparaiso.</p>

<p>In 1851, he visited and explored the island of Juan Fernandez.</p>

<p>In the report of Lieut. Herndon, U. S. N., on his explorations of the Amazon,
he acknowledges his obligations to Mr. Bridges, for invaluable information
furnished, in regard to the head-waters of that river.</p>

<p>In 1855, he proceeded to Panama, remaining there some six months; and
from thence to England, subsequently to France, and finally to California,
where he arrived in November, 1856.</p>

<p>About 1857, he went to British Columbia, and remained nearly two years,
collecting and exploring. In the winter of 1858, his family, hitherto in Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
rejoined him. Since then San Francisco has been his home, though travelling
in many parts of California.</p>

<p>In April, 1865, he undertook his ill-starred journey to Nicaragua. His
explorations here were limited principally to the lake country, where he passed
some five months exploring the dense and tangled jungles of the vicinity;
ascending the volcanoes of Mombacho and Ometepec, and visiting Leon and
Granada. In June, he met at San Juan del Sur, our well-known botanist, Dr.
Torry, on his way to San Francisco. These two kindred spirits passed several
pleasant days together.</p>

<p>He left Nicaragua on the steamship Moses Taylor, Capt Blethen, on the
third of September, 1865, apparently in perfect health. On the fifth, the effects
of the insidious malaria of the country were evident. On the ninth, he died;
being fifty-eight years old. On the seventeenth, the body arrived in San Francisco,
and was afterwards interred at Lone Mountain Cemetery. He leaves a
widow, two daughters, and three sons.</p>

<p>Mr. Bridges was of a singularly retiring and modest disposition, and very
few publications of his own remain to attest his devotion to Natural Science.
But works in every branch of study, particularly of Professor Lindley, and
Sir William Hooker, in the department of Botany, bear abundant evidence of
his untiring industry and unusual success.</p>

<p>That he died a martyr to his love for Natural History, there is no room for
doubt; and his most appropriate memorials are the magnificent evergreens now
adorning, through his agency, the groves and avenues of the old world.</p>

<p>With all impartial naturalists, Mr. Bridges and such as he, “who bear the
burden and heat of the day,” are entitled to honors; if not precisely of the same
character as those due to the students who in their comfortable libraries work
up the results of the collector, still to honors quite as high.</p>

<h3>Notes on Antilocapra Americana, Ord.</h3>

<p class="center">BY DR. C. A. CANFIELD, OF MONTEREY.</p>

<p>The following notes were taken from 1855 to 1858, in Monterey County, California,
and were communicated to Prof. Baird in 1859.</p>

<p>About the first of January the old bucks all shed their horns. A few days
after, one was shot, with two hairy stumps or horn-cores, several inches long,
just tipped with growing horn. This was observed to spread upward and
downward till the whole of the process of the frontal bone was covered with
horn. The “prong” commenced the same process at its tip, and gradually
coalesced with the main horn, leaving no suture. As the horn increases in
length it curves forward and inward. It takes several months to perfect the
new horn. The females possess small curved horns, one to three inches long,
sometimes recurving to the skull, which were not <i>proved</i> to be deciduous.</p>

<p>The horn, when shed, leaves a process of the frontal bone, covered with hair,
soon replaced as above by horn at the tip. These facts were more minutely
observed in two young bucks, reared by hand to the age respectively of one and
two years.</p>

<p>These facts would tend to separate the genus <i>Antilocapra</i> from the family
<i>Cavicornia</i>, and it may possibly form a family by itself.</p>

<h3>Earthquakes in California during 1865.</h3>

<p class="center">BY DR. JOHN B. TRASK.</p>

<p>As in the preceding year we have had much frequency in shocks of earthquake,
with but trifling damage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 9th, 7 h.—A smart shock at Santa Rosa, Sonoma County.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">January</span> 19th, 8 h. 8 m.—A light shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 5th, 8 h. 45 m.—A light shock at Visalia, consisting of a tremulous
motion, succeeded by a roll or wave after an interval of about four seconds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 7th, 23 h.—A smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 8th, 6 h. 22 m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">March</span> 30th, 7 h. 28 m.—A very smart shock at San Francisco; this was
felt at Oakland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 15th, 0 h. 40 m.—A severe shock occurred at San Diego, consisting
of three waves, following each other in quick succession; the shock was preceded
with a loud rushing sound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 18th, 13 h. 31 m.—A light shock at San Francisco, and noticed at
Angel Island and Oakland. This shock was severe at San Juan (south), and
felt at precisely the same hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">April</span> 27th, 15 h. 56 m.—A shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> 24th, 3 h. 21 m.—A smart shock at San Francisco, consisting of a
single wave. At San Juan (south) the earthquake consisted of two sharp
shocks, and at Santa Cruz of one only. At the latter localities it was three
and four minutes later than at this city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">September</span> 22d (no hour).—A smart shock occurred at Yreka.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 1st, 9 h. 15 m.—A very smart shock was felt at Fort Humboldt,
and throughout the district of Humboldt Bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 8th, 12 h. 46 m.—A severe shock at San Francisco. This earthquake
was the most violent of any occurring on this peninsula since the American
occupancy, but was not sufficiently heavy to do serious damage; all the
injuries sustained to property were of a trivial nature, the principal being the
demolition of parts of the parapet walls erected above the roofs, to shield the
latter in cases of fire in adjoining buildings; the fracture of walls in every instance
occurred in insecure buildings, and heavy buildings erected on the made
lands of the city front.</p>

<p>At San José, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz, the earthquake appears to have
been equally severe as in this city. At Petaluma, on the north, it was also
quite severe. At Sacramento the shock was not marked by the same severity
as at the other localities mentioned. At Stockton the shock was heavy, but no
damage done, nor was there any damage at Sacramento. The shock was severe
at Grass Valley.</p>

<p>The direction of the wave in this earthquake was north fifty degrees west;
the limited area over which it extended has not furnished sufficient data to calculate
its velocity.</p>

<p>This earthquake differs from all others that have occurred in this locality in
this particular: the earth continued to vibrate with increasing and again decreasing
degrees of force for ten hours, at no time entirely ceasing during this
period.</p>

<p>22 h. 1 m., another light shock, consisting of a single vibration.</p>

<p>23 h. 50 m., another shock. After this shock the vibrations of the earth
ceased to be noticeable.</p>

<p>October 9th, 10 h. 34 m.—Another light shock.</p>

<p>11 h. 32 m., another shock. After this shock the earth continued to vibrate
at intervals till noon of the tenth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 13th, 2 h. 5 m.—A smart shock at San Francisco; felt at Oakland
and Santa Clara; also at Angel Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 14th, 23 h. 45 m.—Another shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">October</span> 15th, 3 h. 40 m.—Another shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> 24th, 3 h. 45 m.—A smart shock at Watsonville, Santa Cruz Co.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 7th, 1 h. 15 m.—A light shock at San Francisco.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney presented the plate published by Mr. Haidinger,
the distinguished Chief of the Austrian Geological Survey,
to exhibit the structure of the Carleton meteoric iron. This plate,
together with an elaborate article describing the appearance and
structure of this meteorite, is published in the proceedings of the
Vienna Academy of Science, Vol. XLVIII, page 301.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney also made some remarks on the nature and
distribution of the meteorites which have, up to the present time,
been discovered on the Pacific Coast and in Mexico; of these
remarks the following is an abstract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is remarkable that no meteoric stones have ever been discovered, either
near the Pacific coast or, indeed, so far as we know, anywhere on this side of
the Rocky Mountains. Masses of meteoric iron, on the other hand, are known
to exist in quite a number of localities, and many of these masses are of very
large size.</p>

<p>On page eleven, of the third volume of the Academy’s Proceedings, I have
given a list of the localities of meteoric iron known in Arizona and Northern
Mexico. This was done in order to attract the attention of explorers and
prospectors to these remarkable masses, and in the hope of getting more definite
information in regard to some of them. Indeed, some additional items have
already been obtained in reference to the masses there noticed.</p>

<p>It is stated by several persons who have visited Southern Arizona, among
whom Dr. Horn may especially be mentioned, that it is universally believed,
and vouched for by apparently trustworthy explorers, that there are many large
masses of iron near the summit of the range next east of Tucson. This is
called on the latest map of Arizona, (that published by Mr. Gird) the “Sierra
de la Santa Caterina.” Whether this is the same as the “Sierra de la Madera,”
mentioned by Velasco, as the locality of “enormous masses of pure iron, between
Tucson and Tubac,” I have been unable to ascertain.</p>

<p>Dr. J. B. Trask saw, in August, 1849, a large mass of meteoric iron, at the
village of Rio Florida, partly buried in the ground at the corner of the plaza.
This may, perhaps, be the same mass mentioned by Mr. Bartlett, as existing
“at the Hacienda de Concepcion, on the road from Chihuahua to Rio Florida.”
Dr. Trask, however, has a distinct recollection that the mass he saw was at the
village of Rio Florida, and not at the Hacienda.</p>

<p>Dr. Veatch saw, in 1849, a large mass of iron at Santa Rosa, Coahuila,
which was then in use as an anvil, at a blacksmith’s shop, and was informed
that many pieces of native iron had been used there for various purposes. The
mass which Dr. Veatch saw, was of about the size of an ordinary anvil. It
was said to have been brought from the mountains northwest of the town.
This statement corroborates that of Schott, in the Mexican Boundary Report.
(Vol. I, Part 2, page 34.)</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, considering the abundance of meteoric iron near our
borders, that no meteorite, either stony or metallic, has yet been found within
the limits of California. The piece of iron from Honcut Creek, found by Dr.
Trask, and supposed to be of celestial origin, proved, on careful examination, to
be ordinary cast iron. A fragment of the mass was referred to Professor Brush,
and pronounced by him not to be meteoric. The existence of a piece of cast
iron, in the locality where this was discovered, is not easily explained. In connection
with what has just been said of the existence of meteoric iron in California,
it should be added, that Dr. J. G. Cooper thinks that he observed some
small pieces of native iron on the Mohave River, a little above its sink. By
accident no specimen of this supposed meteorite were saved, so that it is not
possible to say that Dr. Cooper may not have been mistaken. The attention
of explorers in that region is invited to this supposed locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>An additional reason for believing Dr. Cooper’s observations to be correct is,
that the locality lies in the prolongation of the path or belt in which a considerable
number of masses of meteoric iron have already been found. It is certainly
either a very interesting fact, or else a remarkable coincidence, that the localities
of meteoric iron in Arizona and northern Mexico, lie nearly in a straight line
with each other, which line extends from northwest to southeast, for a distance
of twelve hundred and fifty miles, or from the Colorado River, at La Paz, to the
province of San Luis Potosi, in Mexico. Along this line, at points from two
hundred to two hundred and fifty miles apart, in some places one mass of iron,
and in others quite a number of them, have fallen, indicating very strongly a
common origin for the whole, or that they may all be fragments of one immense
meteor which passed diagonally across the continent, throwing off masses in its
progress. The large mass of iron discovered by Dr. Evans, on Bald Mountain,
near Port Orford, in Oregon, is in a locality not far distant from the path of
the supposed meteor.</p>

<p>The belt of meteoric iron masses may also be prolonged much farther to the
south, through Mexico, and in the same general southeasterly direction, as far
as the province of Oaxaca. The localities in the provinces of Durango, Zacatecas,
Mexico, and Oaxaca lie very nearly in the same northwest-southeast
direction from each other; but are in a line a little to the west of the main
belt which has been traced down from the Colorado River. It is certain that
the central part of Mexico has been highly favored in respect to the distribution
of meteoric iron masses, which are not only of frequent occurrence, but
often of large size. Perhaps it may be not too wild a speculation to suggest,
that the grand disruption of the meteor may have taken place in this part of its
course, and that the fragments were scattered far and wide in all directions. It
certainly seems difficult to account for the peculiar position of the masses of
iron found on the Pacific side of the continent, and their great abundance in
central Mexico, on any other theory than the one which has here been suggested.</p>

<p>Authorities are not at hand for comparing the chemical composition of all
the masses belonging to this series, or belt, which have been analyzed; but it is
my impression that those meteoric irons which have been examined do resemble
each other sufficiently, in the nature and proportion of the ingredients they contain,
to add to the probability of their having had a common origin. The
specimens thus far analyzed do not represent more than half the localities known
to exist. A farther and more complete investigation of the physical and
chemical character of all the meteoric masses of Arizona and Mexico, with
reference to the possibility of their being originally parts of one body, is suggested
as an interesting subject for those specially devoted to this class of
researches.</p>

<h3>Note on Octopus punctatus, Gabb.</h3>

<p>A half-decayed specimen of this species, (described by Mr. Gabb, in Proc.

afforded the following observations.</p>

<p>The buccal plates or mandibles, resemble those of <i>O. tuberculatus</i>, Blainv.

<p>Professor Whitney communicated the following abstract of the
results obtained by M. Rémond in his geological explorations of
Northern Mexico, made in 1863 to 1865, and drawn up from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
notes and specimens, after reference of the fossils obtained to Mr.
Gabb and Dr. Newberry. M. Rémond has gone to Chili to continue
his geological investigations, if his health permits; and he expects
to write out a more detailed account of his Mexican work, whenever
he has an opportunity of doing so. In the mean time, however,
it is his desire that this abstract should be drawn up and published,
that at least the more important results may be placed as
soon as possible in the hands of those interested in the development
of the geological structure of those countries which border on
the Pacific coast. In presenting this paper, Professor Whitney desired
to express his admiration of the courage and endurance with
which M. Rémond had prosecuted his investigations in Mexico,
where he had to contend with every kind of difficulty and danger,
but where, however, he had obtained results of great value, throwing
the first rays of light on the age of the formations of a very
interesting and economically important mining region—a region
which has been often visited, but where, previous to M. Rémond’s
examinations, no positive evidence of the geological position of any
of the stratified rocks had been obtained, and no clue given to the
relations of the metalliferous veins to each other, or to the rocks in
which they are inclosed.</p>

<p class="center">[Compiled from his notes, and prepared for publication, by J. D. Whitney.]</p>

<h4>1. <span class="smcap">Preliminary Remarks.</span></h4>

<p>The mountainous region comprising the central and western portion of Northern
Mexico, belongs to the four States of Durango, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Sonora.
Considering how celebrated this portion of Mexico has become for its
mines and metalliferous veins, and how much has been written about it, it is
surprising how little exact information has hitherto been obtained with regard
to either its geography or geology. On comparing the principal published maps<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
of the region in question, it will be seen at once how much they differ from
each other in their delineations of even its main topographical features, while
the details are entirely wanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The name of the “Sierra Madre” is usually applied to the main range of
mountains of this country, or the western border of the plateau which stretches
north through the territories of the United States, forming what may be called
the great orographical feature of the continent. In Northwestern Mexico this
crumpled border of the great plateau comprises an extensive mountainous region,
by no means forming a continuous single chain, but rather several central
ranges, with associated groups of parallel ridges, all having the same general
course, which is approximately north-northwest, and south-southeast. As the
breadth of the chain widens as we go towards the north, so, too, that of the
valleys increases in that direction, the whole system of mountains and valleys
spreading out in something like a fan shape.</p>

<p>Going north, the chain appears to sink gradually, although determinations of
altitude in Northern Mexico are extremely few in number. It is certain that
there is, in about latitude 32°, a depression of the mountain ranges which extends
entirely across the continent, and which would enable the traveler to
cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific, without necessarily surmounting any
elevation greater than four thousand feet.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The southeastern range is the highest,
and the culminating point is said to be the Cerro de Cuiteco, sixty leagues
northeast of Jesus Maria, on the western border of Chihuahua. The approximate
altitude of the Cumbre de Basascachic is seven thousand four hundred
and twenty-nine feet, and that of Guadalupe y Calvo, seven thousand eight
hundred and twenty-five feet. To the north, the ranges east of Sahuaripa are
also very high; but they have never been measured. No peaks or ridges, however,
in this portion of Mexico attain anything like the elevation of the higher
portion of the Sierra Nevada, few if any points exceeding ten thousand feet in
altitude.</p>

<p>The direction of the sierra is nearly that of a line connecting some of the
best mining districts in Mexico, which are situated on or very near the summit
of the mountains. These districts are the following, enumerating them in their
geographical order from the south towards the north: In Durango, San Antonio
de las Ventanas, Guarisamey, and San Dimas, remarkable for their auriferous
silver ores, and sixty-two Mexican leagues northeast of Mazatlan; in Chihuahua,
Guadalupe y Calvo, and San Pedro de Batopilas, yielding fine specimens
of native silver; also, Jesus Maria, in the same State, and the Real del la
Cieneguita, Sonora, with silver and gold mines.</p>

<h4>2. <span class="smcap">General Geology.</span></h4>

<p>The geological structure of the occidental slope of the Sierra Madre, as well
as that of the other parts of this great chain, is exceedingly interesting, and, as
yet but very little known, notwithstanding the valuable investigations of Humboldt
and other eminent men; for, up to the present time, the age of the different
formations has never been fixed with any degree of accuracy, from want of
materials and of sufficient observations. In 1863, 1864, and 1865, however, I
explored quite a number of localities in northwestern Mexico, and was thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
enabled to obtain a pretty good general idea of the geology of that region;
and, in Sonora, to which my attention was especially devoted, I succeeded in
finding fossils in sufficient quantity to allow of the determination of the age of
the principal formations of the northern Sierra Madre. By tracing the connection
of these rocks with those of Central Mexico, additional light will be thrown
on those districts of which, at present, but little is definitely known.</p>

<p>The igneous rocks, which occur more abundantly on the Pacific slope, are
granites, either fine or very coarse-grained; porphyries, more or less feldspathic;
and greenstones, all of which are cut by numerous dykes of extremely varied
character. The granites, however, are very poor in veins of the precious metals,
while the porphyries are highly metalliferous. In Sinaloa (Candelero) and
Durango (San Dimas) we see that the granites underlie the metalliferous porphyries,
and that the greenstones, in Sonora, (near Hermosillo and in the vicinity
of La Haciendita) penetrate through them.</p>

<p>The oldest sedimentary rocks, which I have observed, belong to the Carboniferous
series; this is represented in the eastern part of Sonora, by heavy masses
of limestone, forming very high and rugged ridges, running a little west of north.
The upturned strata are seen, in many places, to rest on granite. Argentiferous
veins occur throughout this formation.</p>

<p>The next group of sedimentary rocks, in order, is the Triassic; this forms
isolated mountain groups in Sonora, and offers an interesting field for investigation.
Instead of limestones, it is made up of heavy beds of quartzites and
conglomerates, with coal-bearing clay shales; all of these are disturbed and
elevated, and rest on greenstones, feldspathic porphyries, or granite. Wherever
metamorphosed, the Triassic rocks are auriferous and contain veins of silver ores.
The metamorphic slates and limestones of the Altar and Magdalena districts,
which include the richest gold placers of Sonora, may possibly be of Triassic
age; but the fossils collected are too imperfect to admit of this being determined.
There are some reasons for believing those rocks to be rather of Jurassic than
of Triassic age, as they differ in lithological characters from both the Triassic
and Carboniferous of Northern Mexico, resembling, rather, the Jurassic gold-bearing
slates of the Sierra Nevada, in California; besides, they lie outside and
to the west of the Sierra Madre. It may also be noticed that the gold which
they furnish does not resemble that obtained from the Triassic strata.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous period is also represented at the foot of the Sierra Madre, at
Arivechi, in Sonora. The strata belonging to this series are chiefly argillaceous
shales, and they rest upon porphyries and Carboniferous limestone. They have
been disturbed and elevated since their deposition. The fossils, which they contain
in great number and in a fine state of preservation, will be noticed farther on.</p>

<p>All the above mentioned formations were already in existence before the first
eruption of the volcanic rocks took place. These latter are found scattered
along the whole Pacific coast, and extend from the Gulf of California up to the
very summit of the sierra. It is very interesting to see the volcanic formations
spread over so extensive a region, especially as there are no active volcanoes
known in Northern Mexico, and not even any indications of ancient craters or
vents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The lithological character of the eruptive materials is extremely varied, and
there seem to have been several periods of igneous action preceded by as many
disturbances of the strata, all of which took place after the close of the Cretaceous
epoch. Three different series of volcanic rocks may be observed in Sinaloa
and Sonora, unconformable with each other; and these may again be subdivided
into groups, after a thorough examination has been made of the extensive
suite of specimens which has been collected. The lower, or oldest series, affords
several hundred varieties of porphyries, characterized by crystals of feldspar or
augite. There are also very peculiar trachytic rocks, resembling granite in
appearance. These volcanic materials occur in beds or in masses, and are frequently
cut by dykes; but they are quite destitute of veins containing gold or
silver, the only metalliferous ores they contain being those of copper (?) and
iron, and these in small quantity. Various volcanic ridges in Sonora belong to
this class. The second series consists of extensive beds of micaceous, trachytic
tufas, and breccias, all more or less uplifted since their deposition, and covering
the different igneous and sedimentary formations as well as the older volcanic
porphyries. These attain a great thickness, between San Dimas and San Ignacio,
in Durango and Sinaloa.</p>

<p>Above these formations occur ancient alluvial deposits, with bones of extinct
animals (elephants) at two localities; near La Noria, northeast of Mazatlan,
and in the Arroya de la Palma, two leagues east of La Casita, in Sonora.</p>

<p>Sheets of basaltic lavas, somewhat similar to those of California, and probably
of the same age, forming with tufas the upper volcanic series, overlie the other
formations, occupying a nearly horizontal position.</p>

<p>The most recent formation is that of the terrace deposits of sand and gravel,
which occur in Sonora.</p>

<p>Having thus given a general sketch of the principal groups of rocks developed
in the region in question, I pass to a more detailed description of the different
formations.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Granites.</span></h5>

<p>Underlying all the rocks in Durango and Sinaloa, and probably posterior to
the Carboniferous limestones, which they have in places extensively metamorphosed,
are masses of granite. These may be seen in many places between the
coast and San Dimas, either occupying the bottoms of the valleys, or forming
independent hills. There are two well-marked varieties: Of these the first are
syenites, more or less fine-grained, and consisting of a mixture of feldspar, variously
colored, quartz, black or green hornblende, and black or brown mica, the
latter usually in hexagonal plates. Localities of this variety are: Haval, Las
Higueras, San Ignacio, Santa Apolonia, Candelero, La Noria, Zaragoza, etc.,
in Sinaloa; San Marcial and Tecoripa valleys, Hermosillo, in Sonora. The
other variety is either very coarse-grained, consisting of white feldspar, gray
quartz, and plates of silvery mica, or else finer grained, and chiefly made up of
feldspar; these occur, forming mountains and ridges in Sonora, in the Sierra
del Amolé, near La Magdalena, Sierra del Espinaso Prieto, near Hermosillo,
and the Sierra de Mazatan, south of Ures. The fine-grained granites contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
argentiferous veins at Zaragoza, in Sinaloa, and east of Topisco, in Sonora.
These are traversed by numerous intersecting dykes of diorite, feldspar, and
quartziferous and feldspathic porphyries, especially well seen near Hermosillo,
and the Cajon de los Carrisos, east of San Antonio de la Huerta. There are
no metalliferous veins where the granite is thus intersected by dykes.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Metalliferous Porphyries.</span></h5>

<p>These may be divided into two groups. The first consists of a rock occurring
in large irregular masses or beds, and having a dark colored argillaceous base,
through which are disseminated small crystals of whitish feldspar. This variety,
which is probably older than the granites, includes some of the richest mines of
the Sierra Madre; as those of Candelaria, Bolaños, Cinco Señores, etc., near
San Dimas, in Durango; and which have yielded over $20,000,000. There
are also rich veins in this kind of rock at Candelero, fifty-two leagues northeast
of Mazatlan, in Sinaloa. All these veins run northeast and southwest, and are
cut at right angles by dykes. The second variety of porphyry is a gray feldspathic
rock, apparently made up of labradorite and magnetic iron ore; this
overlies the greenstones, and is covered by the Triassic beds at Los Bronces and
San Javier, where there are three systems of argentiferous veins. The Nahuila
mine, one of the best in Sonora, is in this rock.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Metamorphic Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>Heavy masses of metamorphic rocks may be seen at various localities in Sinaloa
and Durango (Tecomate, Tenchoquelite, Arroyo del Ciruelo, Arroyo de San
Vincente) resting either on the granites or the metalliferous porphyries. These
rocks occur in masses or beds, sometimes distinctly stratified, and sometimes without
any traces of the original bedding. They are always much altered and broken
up. Their lithological characters are not well marked, although the series is
easily recognized. The rocks referred to in this division, are usually fine-grained,
of a greenish or bluish color, when not too much decomposed, and somewhat
argillaceous in composition. At the base they pass into porphyries. The argentiferous
veins cut both the metamorphic and the porphyritic rocks at Tecomate,
on the Rio de San Ignacio, where the dip of the formation is to the northeast,
at an angle of 70°. Between La Puerta and El Pilar, Arroyo de San Dimas,
they occur in jaspery layers, ribboned with green and brown hues, and resemble
some of the metamorphic Triassic rocks of Sonora. Near Candelero, the metamorphic
rocks are associated with whitish, semi-crystalline limestone. The formation
in question may be observed in many other localities in Sinaloa, always
resting on granite and passing into porphyry; it is also sometimes associated
with metamorphic slates.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Greenstones.</span></h5>

<p>These rocks occur in heavy masses or in beds, and are made up of a fine-grained,
compact mixture of hornblende and feldspar, often containing mica,
and having a greenish color. The greenstone underlies the Triassic rocks, and
in many places it protrudes through the granite. This rock is highly metalliferous
at Copála, Sinaloa, and also at Los Bronces and San Javier, in Sonora.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
The greenstones or diorites which occur in the granite, appear to be anterior to
the metalliferous greenstones, and the latter are posterior to the Triassic.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Carboniferous Limestones.</span></h5>

<p>The Carboniferous limestones form high ridges parallel with the general
course of the Sierra Madre, from Hermosillo, north of Guaymas, east of Sahuaripa.
These ridges become more elevated as we approach the crest of the
Sierra. The rocks of this formation are fine-grained and bluish in color, and
form heavy beds with intercalated schistose layers; they contain nodules and
beds of flint. There are some clay slates at the base of the formation. The
thickness of the whole series is probably over five thousand feet. The principal
localities where these Carboniferous rocks may be observed are as follows, naming
them in order from west to east:</p>

<p>1st. Hermosillo, where they rest on syenitic granite and are highly metamorphosed,
the limestones being converted into white saccharoidal marble, and the
slates into garnet and epidote rock. Dykes of green porphyry cut through the
beds of sedimentary rock, which beds have a strike of about N. 65° W., and
stand nearly vertical.</p>

<p>2d. Five leagues from Hermosillo, at La Cruz; in the Cerro de Santa Teresa
on the south, and the Sierra de Las Animas on the north. Here the limestones
contain crinoids.</p>

<p>3d. Four leagues farther on, between La Noria and El Aguajito; here are
high granite ridges with a granite axis.</p>

<p>4th. Twenty leagues from Hermosillo, south of Ures; Carboniferous rocks
upheaved on the southwest side of the granitic Sierra de Mazatan. The direction
of this range is from northwest to southeast, and its height sixteen
hundred varas, according to M. De Fleury; here are a few silver mines.</p>

<p>5th. Haciendita, nine leagues farther northeast. The beds here are metamorphosed
and much disturbed, dipping northeast; these outcrops form low hills.</p>

<p>6th. Between Mátape and Batuco; a very high ridge of granite, running in
a northerly direction, with limestone resting upon it. To the north and east of
Topisco the limestones attain a great thickness and afford fine fossils. At the
Cerro de la Bonacina, one of the highest points of the range, a variety of
corals, crinoids, and brachiopods may be seen weathered out from the surface of
several beds of hard, compact limestone, of various colors; these beds are near
the summit of the mountain. This locality was first discovered by Don Antonio
Moreno, Engineer of the Bronces mine. The strata here are much disturbed,
and appear to have been folded into a mass with a synclinal structure.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Triassic Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>This formation is usually highly metamorphosed, and passes into porphyries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
at its base. The strata are more or less inclined, and the lower beds are very
much contorted and disturbed. The rocks referred to the Trias extend from
Soyopa to San Javier; but they are developed on a more extensive scale
between San Antonio de la Huerta and Los Bronces, forty-two leagues northeast
of Guaymas. The Triassic rocks form a chain of high and rugged mountains
extending from south-southeast to north-northwest. The isolated mining
districts of Tecoripa and San Marcial (between Los Bronces and Guaymas) are
in the same formation; it also crops out from under the stratified volcanic rocks
at the Punta de Agua, between San Marcial and Guaymas. The metalliferous
greenstones and porphyries, previously noticed, form the nucleus around which
the Triassic beds have been upheaved. These beds are seen near San Javier
and Los Bronces, two mining towns which are situated on greenstone, but which
skirt the foot of a small ridge of feldspathic porphyry, much less elevated than
the metamorphic rocks themselves. They are also seen overlying granite, near
the Cerro Colorado, between Soyopa and Los Bronces, and south of Tecoripa.
The Cerro de la Nahuila, the highest point but one in the district, lies southeast
of the Sierra de Mazatan. There are three principal divisions of the Triassic,
which occur in the following order, the first mentioned being the lowest:</p>

<p>The interstratified clay shales and grits of the lower member, crop out in
several places along the Cañada de Santa Maria, at the bottom of the ravines
below Los Bronces. Here, there are three or four beds of good anthracite coal,
with a considerable number of well-preserved plants occurring in the associated
clay shales, both above and below the coal.</p>

<p>[A portion of these plants were referred by me to Dr. Newberry for examination,
and he has given the following list of them. 1. <i>Strangerites magnifolia</i>,
Rogers; Trans. Assoc. Am. Geologists, p. 306, Pl. xiv. A species occurring
in the Trias (?) of Virginia and North Carolina. 2. <i>Pecopteris falcatus</i>, Emmons;
Geol. of N. Car., Pl. iv, fig. 9. The specimens are too imperfect to
decide on the identity of this plant with <i>Saccopteris germinans</i>. ?3. <i>Pecopteris
bullatus</i>, Bunbury; only in fruit; nervation obscure; identity not certain, but
very probable. 4. <i>Otozamites Macombii</i>, Newb. At top of “red beds” or
“gypsum formation,” at the base of the Cretaceous rocks, copper mines near
Abiquiu, New Mexico. There is no doubt about this species, and it forms an
important connecting link. ?5. <i>Pterozamites decussatus</i>, Emmons; specimens
very imperfect. 6. <i>Pecopteris</i>, n. sp.; a very neat and peculiar species as yet
undescribed. It may be the same as one badly figured by Emmons (Pl. II, fig. 1.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
7. <i>Alethopteris</i>, n. sp.; small fragments of the frond of a splendid new
species. From this enumeration it will be seen that there can be but little doubt
of the Triassic age of the formation in which these plants occur. A large lot
of these plants, collected by M. Rémond, has been recently received, and among
them are much better specimens of some of the species noticed by Dr. Newberry,
and several quite new ones. These will also be examined, described, and figured
within a short time. <span class="smcapuc">J. D. W.</span>]</p>

<p>The strike and dip of the clay shales in the different ravines vary considerably,
but the dip is usually to the southeast. The superincumbent quartzites are
more regular in their inclination. There are dykes of feldspathic rock cutting
through both the coal and the shales.</p>

<p>The following section represents, in an ascending order, the position of the
coal-bearing strata in the Cañon del Retiro, near Los Bronces.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Coarse quartzites with conglomerates.</li>
<li>2. Conglomerate, 8 feet.</li>
<li>3. Argillaceous and schistose grits, 3 feet.</li>
<li>4. Clay shales, with impressions of plants, 8 feet.</li>
<li>5. Gray grits, 4 feet.</li>
<li>6. Bluish clay shales with ferns, 12 feet.</li>
<li>7. Coal, 2 feet.</li>
<li>8. Compact black clay shales, 5 inches.</li>
<li>9. Coal, 2 feet 6 inches.</li>
<li>10. Clay shales with leaves, several feet.</li>
<li>11. Coarse grits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another section, measured at the foot of the Cerro de la Aguja, was as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Compact gray grits.</li>
<li>2. Gray clay shales with seams of coal and plants, 4 feet 6 inches.</li>
<li>3. Bluish argillaceous grits, 2 feet 6 inches.</li>
<li>4. Contorted black clay shales, with seams of coal, 5 feet 6 inches.</li>
<li>5. Coal, 2 feet 6 inches.</li>
<li>6. Black, compact clay shales, 3 feet.</li>
<li>7. Coal, 7 inches.</li>
<li>8. Carbonaceous clay shales, 8 inches.</li>
<li>9. Coal, 3 inches.</li>
<li>10. Clay shales and argillaceous grits.</li>
</ul>

<p>[Specimens of the coal brought to San Francisco by M. Rémond, are anthracite,
evidently of superior quality. <span class="smcapuc">J. D. W.</span>]</p>

<p>The middle member of the Triassic series consists of quartzites, or metamorphic
sandstones; these are both coarse and fine grained, and sometimes brecciated.
They vary in color, from white to red, and are often much altered in the
vicinity of the metalliferous veins. The upper member of the series, as seen in
the Cañada de la Tinta, is made up of rounded pebbles of black jasper and gray
quartzite; in the Cañada de los Mimbres, below Los Bronces pebbles of specular
iron are included in the mass. The dip of the formation is very irregular,
both in direction and amount.</p>

<p>At San Antonio de la Huerta, Tecoripa, and San Marcial, argentiferous
veins of various ages occur in the lower and middle members of the Trias. At
San Marcial, marine (?) shells are found in the clay slates, near the silver mines;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
[but those which have been obtained, are too imperfect for recognition; they
were referred to Mr. Meek for examination. <span class="smcapuc">J. D. W.</span>]</p>

<p>At San Marcos, between San Antonio de la Huerta and the Real Viejo,
metamorphic jaspery slates occur in connection with the carboniferous limestones;
they are probably of Triassic age. Gold is found in the gulches between
the quartzite ridges, as in the Cañada de la Higuera, near Los Bronces
in the Cañada de la Iglesia, between the latter place and San Antonio de la
Huerta, and generally where the quartzites occur.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Jurassic (?) Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>In the eastern part of the Magdalena and Altar districts, are valleys with
low hills and ridges of auriferous clay slates, with interstratified beds of porphyry
and diorite. Localities of these rocks are Cerros de la Barajita, between
Querobabi and Santa Ana; Cerritos de la Tierra Colorada, where the formation
contains beds of variously colored limestones, entirely made up of fossils,
South of La Magdalena this formation rests on metamorphic sandstones and
shales. [The reasons for referring these rocks, with doubt, to the Jurassic formation,
have been already given; see page 246.]</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Cretaceous Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>In the Sahuaripa Valley, four miles east of Arivechi, and seventy-two leagues
northeast of Guaymas, is a locality of Cretaceous Fossils of great interest. The
hill in which they occur is called “Cerro de las Conchas,” or “Shell Mountain.”
The rocks exposed are unfossiliferous strata of coarse-grained sandstone
at the base, overlain by clay shales and argillaceous limestone filled with fossils.
The exposure is very limited in extent: the shales are a few hundred feet thick,
and they dip to the east, as do also the beds of carboniferous limestone on which
the Cretaceous deposits rest. Masses of porphyry crop out from under the
shales, without there being any peculiar indication of metamorphism or disturbance
in their vicinity. Other patches of shelly rock are said to occur in the
valley on the eastern side, at the foot of the sierra. [A small lot of fossils
collected here by M. Rémond were referred to Mr. Gabb for examination; and
since that, a considerable number of additional specimens have been received,
but have not yet been investigated. Several species were identified as already
described from Texas, and figured by Roemer in “Die Kreidebildungen von
Texas;” these are, <i>Ammonites pedernalis</i>, von Buch; <i>Natica pedernalis</i>, Roem.;
<i>Turritella seriatim-granulata</i>, Roem.; <i>Gryphæa navis</i>, Hall; <i>Cyphosoma Texanum</i>,
Roem.; <i>Eulima Texana</i>, Roem. Besides these, two other species are
identified, namely; <i>Cardium multistriatum</i>, Shum., and <i>Turbinolia Texana</i>,
Con.</p>

<p>There is a considerable number of new species among the specimens from
this locality, among which the following genera are represented: <i>Turritella</i>,
<i>Chemnitzia</i>, <i>Avellana</i>, <i>Cardium</i>, <i>Trigonia</i>, <i>Panopæa</i>, <i>Pinna</i>, <i>Cucullæa</i>, etc.
These will be described and figured by Mr. Gabb, who also remarks that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
character of the fossils indicates a closer relationship of the formation to the
eastern Cretaceous than to that of California.—<span class="smcapuc">J. D. W.</span>]</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Volcanic Rocks.</span></h5>

<p>Stratified volcanic deposits cover a broad area of the surface between San
Ignacio and San Dimas (Sinaloa and Durango); they dip to the west. On the
other side of Durango they dip in the opposite direction. The serrated edges
of the strata may be seen from a great distance, and are extremely picturesque,
towering up like old ruins, their peculiar forms being due to erosion. They are
well seen in the Cerro de los Frayles, near Guarisamey, in Durango; visible from
Mazatlan. These belong to the second series of volcanic rocks. In Sonora
there are three different series of volcanic deposits which form serrated, picturesque,
parallel ridges, running north from Guaymas as far as La Magdalena, or
over eighty leagues in a straight line. The three main ridges, enumerated from
west to east, are, 1, Las Tetas de Cabra; 2, Guaymas de Zaragosa; 3, Range
north of the mouth of the Yaqui River. The description of the various volcanic
deposits of Northern Mexico may be reserved for a separate memoir, as
the number of them is very great.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Mines.</span></h5>

<p>The richest and widest veins are those northeast of Mazatlan, near San Dimas,
Guarisamey, etc., in Durango. These veins cut all the rocks older than the Cretaceous,
whether igneous or sedimentary. The mines of Sinaloa are richer than
those of Sonora. In the former State the ore-bearing portion of the veins is
from a few feet to several yards in width: in the latter, generally from one to
two feet. In Durango and Sinaloa gold, native silver, and sulphuret of silver
occur associated with galena, yellow blende, and iron pyrites. In Sonora the
principal ores are argentiferous gray copper, with galena, black blende, copper
pyrites, arsenical pyrites, carbonate of lead, ruby silver, arsenical silver, and
gold. Each mining district is characterized by a peculiar system of veins; in
all as many as twenty different systems have been observed. The most
abundant vein stones are quartz, either chalcedonic, crystalline, or massive;
brown spar; heavy spar; oxide of iron. The veins occurring in the metamorphic
Triassic rocks, are usually parallel with the stratification, so that they
lie nearly horizontal where the formation has been but little disturbed. As to
the yield of the silver ores, it varies extremely, and it would be necessary to
enter into a full description of all the different districts to give an idea of it.
It may be noticed, however, that the arsenical pyrites, which is auriferous in
the Sierra Nevada, becomes argentiferous in the Sierra Madre. The veins
vary in their direction from a little east to a little west of north; the richest
ores near San Dimas run northeast and southwest. There are but few rich
mines in Sonora, a state of which the mineral wealth has been much exaggerated.
There are, however, some deposits of variegated copper, and veins
of magnetic and specular iron.</p>

<p>The annexed tabular statement will give the principal facts obtained with
regard to the mines examined in Northern Mexico.</p>

<h3>Description of a new California Helix, with notes on others
already described.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. G. COOPER, M.D.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Helix</span> (Arianta) <span class="smcap">sequoicola</span>, Cooper.</h4>

<p>Sp. Ch. <i>H. testa</i> rotundata, umbilicata, spira depressa, anfr. ult. nonnunquam
subangulata; anfr. vi ad vii et dimidium, perist. obliqua superne parum deflecta;
labio tenui, reflexo, infra crassiore, acuta. Colore atrobrunnea, vel olivacea,
zona nigra, lata, inter duabus ochraceis sita, in spira semicelata, labio albo;
intus læte purpureo, zonis duabus albis. Epidermide nitente, infra polita, striis
incrementis læve perspicuis, interdum tenuissime malleata, rugis spiralibus;
supra punctis piliferis creberrime induta; pilis brevissimis junioris deciduis.</p>

<p><i>Animal</i> schisto-colore; corpore cylindraceo rugosa, tentaculis longis, pede
postice elongata, cuneata.</p>

<p><i>Testæ</i> lat., major, 0.93 ad 1.20; minor 0.76 ad 0.96; alt. 0.42 ad 0.54
poll. Angl.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Santa Cruz, California, in ligno carioso, locis humidissimis.</p>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i> Shell rounded, umbilicate, spire depressed, last whorl
sometimes subangulate, whorls 6 to 6½, peristome oblique, little deflected above;
labium thin, reflexed, thickest below; acute. Color dark brown or olivaceous,
with a broad black band between two yellow ones, half hidden on the spire,
lips white; within a fine purple with two white bands. Epidermis shining,
polished below, the lines of growth faintly visible, sometimes very lightly malleated,
and with spiral ridges; above with crowded scars bearing very short
bristles in the young shell which fall off in the adult.</p>

<p><i>Animal</i> slate colored, body cylindrical, rugose, tentacles moderate; foot
elongated, behind wedge-shaped.</p>

<p><i>Shell</i>—large diameter 0.96 to 1.20; smaller diameter 0.76 to 0.96; height 0.42
to 0.54 hundredths of an inch.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i> Santa Cruz, Cal., among decayed trees in the dampest places.</p>

<p>This beautiful species is quite rare, only three adult and twelve young specimens
having been found after long searching. It will probably occur more
commonly in some part of the redwood forests which I have been unable to
explore. It approaches nearest to <i>H. Dupetithouarsi</i> and <i>H. fidelis</i>, being
between them in form and size as well as colors, but the pilosity at once distinguishes
it. Its distinct bands and rounded whorls separate it from <i>H. infumata</i>
and <i>Hillebrandii</i>, the latter when perfect having also much longer hairs.
The animal is lighter colored than those of <i>H. arrosa</i>, <i>Nickliniana</i>, <i>redimita</i>,
<i>ramentosa</i>, <i>tudiculata</i>, (which are all very similar) but much darker than that
of <i>Dupetithouarsi</i>, and I believe also of <i>fidelis</i> and <i>infumata</i>. The form of the
shell is a link connecting these with <i>Mormonum</i>.</p>

<p>In the tabular arrangement adopted in my State Survey Report, it would
come in as the pilose analogue of <i>H. Dupetithouarsi</i>, and <i>H. exarata</i>, which are
also its nearest geographical neighbors, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

</table>

<p>Judging from the form of <i>H. Mormonum</i>, it is possible that the young will
be found to be hirsute.</p>

<p>The table referred to includes twelve other banded species of California,
arranged under the same headings. It is interesting to observe that the § A 1
and B 1 groups inhabit coniferous forests, and probably feed chiefly on fungi
found in decaying wood while § C, including also H. <i>Nickliniana</i>, <i>Bridgesii</i>,
<i>redimita</i>, <i>ramentosa</i>, <i>tudiculata</i>, <i>Californiensis</i> (and <i>Carpenteri</i>?) are found in
woods of oak, etc. Another group which I place in § A (as not being
rugose) are found in dry, treeless localities where they seem to represent those
last mentioned, the size, form, and number of whorls furnishing parallels, but
being usually less in size, as might be expected of species from arid regions, and
often with the band single or obscured; these are H. <i>Tryoni</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25b"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, <i>rufocincta</i>,
<i>Kellettii</i>, <i>crebristriata</i>, <i>Gabbii</i>, <i>facta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25c"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The bandless species, of which there are few on this coast, present analogous
sections as to surface characters, and exhibit much greater varieties in the form
of their apertures, by which they can be arranged in groups, having a greater
development of species in the Atlantic States and more distinguishable by form
than by surface.</p>

<p><i>H. Townsendiana</i> alone approaches § C in its rugose sculpture, but otherwise
differs greatly from the usual types of California.</p>

<p>From the shells alone, five subgenera may be established out of the banded
group, which I will describe in a future article.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—There is a single specimen of Helix in the State Collection, supposed
to have been obtained in the Mount Diablo range by Prof. Brewer, which
closely resembles the small form of <i>H. Sequoicola</i> in shape, but being nearly
bleached is too imperfect to describe minutely, though very likely a new species.</p>

<p>It is remarkable for having seven whorls, while the former and <i>H. Mormonum</i>
of the same size have but six; it is also less compressed than the latter,
and the umbilicus is less covered. The color where remaining is shining gamboge
yellow (faded?) with a <i>single</i> very narrow band <i>above</i> the middle, not
showing the pale band on each side of it that is so marked in others of the group.
The sculpture seems to have been very <i>slightly</i> malleated, and with the faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
lines of growth cut by smooth depressed waved grooves transversely, and thus
obliquely to the sutures (while those of <i>H. Traskii</i> are parallel).</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 0.95; alt. 0.40 inch.</p>

<p>A region so near San Francisco ought to furnish more and better specimens.</p>

<p>There is a form referred to <i>H. fidelis</i>, from Humboldt Bay, which may also
prove a new species. It is entirely purplish black, <i>without bands</i>, the lips white
inside, and differs from <i>infumata</i> chiefly in great elevation and thicker lips,
having even the subcarinate body whorl of the latter, and the same number of
whorls (6½). There is, however, no trace of bristle marks, and some specimens
appear to connect it with <i>fidelis</i>, suggesting a possibility of its being a
hybrid.</p>

<p>The State Collection contains one specimen, obtained from the late Dr. Frick.</p>

<p>Diam. maj. 1.24; min. 1.09; alt. 0.70 inch.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<h3>On a New Subfamily of Fluviatile Mollusca.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. H. DALL, ACTING DIRECTOR SCI. CORPS, W. U. T. EX.</p>

<p>A paper was read by Dr. Isaac Lea, before the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Sciences, April 1st, 1856, in which he described a new genus (<i>Pompholyx</i>)
and species (<i>P. effusa</i>, Lea) of fluviatile mollusca, from California. He
placed it in the <i>Family</i> LYMNÆANA without remark.</p>

<p>In the “<i>Genera of Recent mollusca</i>,” by H. &amp; A. Adams, it is referred to
(Vol. II, p. 645, Pl. CXXXVIII, fig. 11) as the only species of the genus and
is placed in the <i>Family</i> LIMNÆIDÆ.</p>

<p>It is not mentioned by Chenu, in the “<i>Manuel de Conchyliologie</i>.”</p>

<p>In the “<i>Supplementary Report to the British Association</i>,” by Dr. P. P. Carpenter
(page 674), are given the views of Mr. W. G. Binney, one of the most
eminent of American conchologists and particularly devoted to the Pulmonates.
He places the mollusk in question, between the genera <i>Limnæa</i> and <i>Physa</i>, in
the <i>Subfamily</i> <span class="smcap">Limnæinæ</span>, of the <i>Family</i> LIMNÆIDÆ.</p>

<p>Investigations as to the animal, however, suggest the propriety of separating
it, if not (as a <i>Family Pompholidæ</i>) entirely from the <i>Family</i> LIMNÆIDÆ,
at least in a subfamily by itself.</p>

<p>In the few specimens which I have been able to examine with regard to the
dentition, the dried animal has not yielded very satisfactory results, and I do
not, therefore, feel justified in entirely separating it until more is known.</p>

<p>In the following table, a West Coast species is given as a type of each genus:</p>

Above, rounded planulate, suture deep but not channelled. Below,
not umbilicated, rounded convex. Aperture large, effuse, internally
shining. Columella flattened, not folded; externally, in fresh specimens,

<p>I am indebted to Mr. Wm. M. Gabb, of the State Geological Survey, for
notes and drawings, confirmatory of previous doubts in regard to this rare and
interesting mollusk. They were taken from the living animal, and coming from

<p>Professor Whitney made some remarks on the geology of the
State of Nevada, of which the following is an abstract.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Having recently received a small but very interesting collection of fossils,
made in Nevada by Mr. J. E. Clayton, the examination of which has added
considerably to our scanty stock of information in regard to the geology of an
extensive region comprised between the meridians of 115° and 120°, and the
parallels of 38° and 41°, I take this occasion to set forth, in a very concise
manner, the information which I have collected, up to the present time, in regard
to the age of the sedimentary formations of the regions in question.</p>

<p>The State of Nevada occupies a portion of the continent which, during the
last few years, has received a large share of attention from the public and excited
the greatest interest among scientific men; but where, up to the present
time, detailed geological work has been impossible, owing to the absence of any
geographical map of the State approaching even to accuracy.</p>

<p>The U. S. Pacific Railroad Surveys furnished no geological information
whatever in regard to the territory embraced within the present area of the
State of Nevada. The route from Salt Lake to Humboldt River, at Lassen’s
Meadows, was hastily explored by Captain Beckwith, in May, 1854, and he was
accompanied by Mr. Schiel as Geologist; but no information of any value is
given in regard to the geological structure of the region traversed by the party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
nor were any fossils discovered, although portions of the rocks along their route
have since been proved to be prolific in organic remains.</p>

<p>On all the geological maps of the whole territory of the United States which
have been published up to the present time, the region west of the Rocky
Mountains has been so misrepresented that it is quite impossible to trace any
approximation, or first hinting, at either the age or the outline of the principal
formations. On these maps the region lying between the Salt Lake and the
Sierra Nevada is usually left uncolored, or vaguely designated as “metamorphic”
with patches of “volcanic” and “desert quaternary” scattered through it at
random.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The first paper or publication issued, in which any definite information in
regard to the geology of Nevada was given, was that of Messrs. Meek and Engelmann,
published in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, for April, 1860. This paper gives the results of the examination by
Mr. Meek, of the fossils obtained by Mr. H. Engelmann, who accompanied
Capt. J. H. Simpson on his explorations of 1858-59, or what is generally
known as “Simpson’s Wagon Road Expedition.” As the full report of this
expedition has never been published, we have no other information in regard to
the geology of the region traversed by Capt. Simpson’s party than that given
in the paper above alluded to. The route followed on this survey was one near
the present Overland Stage Road, passing through a region then entirely uninhabited
by white men, but now dotted with mining camps and even towns of
considerable size—a region which has been proved to contain a large number of
argentiferous veins, and where mining operations have been carried on most
energetically and extensively during the last two or three years.</p>

<p>The localities of fossils mentioned by Messrs. Meek and Engelmann, and included
within the limits of Nevada, are as follows: Long. 114° 45´, Lat 39°
45´, near what is now called Egan Cañon, fragments of Trilobites, either of
Upper Silurian or Devonian Age, and “closely resembling Hamilton Group
Forms:”—Long. 115° 58´, Lat. 39° 33´, and Long. 115° 36´, Lat. 39° 30´;
at these two localities, situated in what are now the Eureka and White Pine
Mining Districts, a “group of fossils of decided Devonian type” was found.
This group consisted of <i>Atrypa reticularis</i>, <i>A. aspera</i>, or a closely allied species,
a small <i>Productus</i>, and three new species of <i>Spirifer</i>. This is the most westerly
point, on our territory, at which any fossils belonging to formations older
than the Carboniferous have, up to the present time, been discovered, so far at
least as any published record shows. Between Lon. 115° and 115° 30´ and
Lat. 40° 10´ and 39° 20´, is a group or series of hills, trending nearly north and
south, and made up “of light yellowish gray, more or less argillaceous and arenaceous
subcrystalline limestones and slates.” From these hills fossils were collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
which are referred by Mr. Meek to the Upper Carboniferous series.
Most of the species were new; among them were three species of <i>Productus</i>,
two new species of <i>Spirifer</i>, and another apparently identical with <i>S. cameratus</i>;
also, <i>Athyris subtilita</i> and a new species of <i>Chonetes</i> closely allied to <i>C. Verneuiliana</i>;
these localities are near what is now known as Ruby Valley and
Fort Ruby.</p>

<p>The above are all the localities of fossils, in Nevada, known to have been
published up to this time, excepting those which have been described or noticed
in the publications of the Geological Survey of California. Messrs. Meek and
Engelmann state, at the end of their paper, that igneous rocks predominate
west of the 116th degree of longitude as far as the Sierra Nevada, and that
only a few traces of stratified rock were found in that district in none of which
any organic remains were observed. The exploration of this region, supposed
to be destitute of fossiliferous rocks, has proved, however, that it contains immense
ranges of stratified beds which, in a considerable number of localities at
least, are highly prolific in well preserved fossils.</p>

<p>As soon as the Humboldt mining region began to be resorted to by miners,
which was in 1861 and 1862, fossils were discovered by several persons, who
about the same time furnished us with collections of value and interest.
The most important of these collections were those of Mr. Gorham Blake and
of Mr. R. Homfray. The specimens obtained by these gentlemen, as well as
others of the same age obtained by the Survey, near Dayton, Nevada, and also
in Genesee Valley, California, were figured and described by Mr. Gabb in the
first volume of the Palæontology of California, forming a part of the series of
publications of the Geological Survey. The geological age of the formation is
that of the Hallstadt Limestone of the Austrian Alps, or the Upper Trias,
there being several species at the above cited localities which are identical with
European species from this geological position, as determined by Mr. Gabb,
and confirmed by Von Hauer, the eminent palæontologist of the Austrian Geological
Survey.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Since the publication of the Palæontology of California, Vol. I, our stock of
information with regard to the range and extent of the Upper Trias, in Nevada,
has been considerably increased by the explorations of members of the Survey,
and other persons who have furnished us with specimens from their collections, or
given us information as to the character of the rocks noticed by them on their
lines of travel. We now know that the Triassic rocks occupy a broad belt of
country extending from the 117th meridian west to the line dividing the States
of Nevada and California, and lying between the parallels of 38° and 40°.
Within the area thus designated, Triassic fossils have been found at several
localities, some of which are remarkable for the number and good state of preservation
of the various species. Among these localities that of the Volcano
District is remarkable for the size and beauty of the Ammonites found there.
This is about thirty miles east of the south end of Walker’s Lake. New Pass
District, twenty miles west of Austin, is also a rich locality of Triassic fossils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
At two or three points within this Triassic area there are indications of the
existence of fossiliferous rocks occupying a higher position than the Trias, and
perhaps of Liassic Age; but the collections have not yet been sufficiently studied
to justify a positive opinion on this point.</p>

<p>The sedimentary strata in this region are much broken up and metamorphosed
by intrusive rocks, of which there is a great variety, granite being one
of the most abundant. In the southern portion of the area designated above
as including stratified rocks of Triassic age, a very large part of the surface is
occupied by volcanic materials, apparently a continuation of the very recent
volcanic masses near Mono Lake. Lava is said to be the predominating rock
over the region to the southeast of Walker’s Lake, and as far in that direction
as the State line between Nevada and Arizona. The same is true of the
region to the north and northwest of Humboldt River, where granitic and
volcanic rocks are reported as occurring, and where, so far as known, no fossils
have yet been obtained. This, however, is a region as yet but little explored,
on account of the number and warlike disposition of the Indians.</p>

<p>Between the 116th and 117th meridians is a region of granitic and volcanic
rocks, including two principal north and south ranges, and many spurs and side
ranges. The Toiyabe range, in which are the mines of Austin, or the Reese
River mines, and which is a little east of the 117th meridian, is mostly granitic.
Stratified but highly metamorphosed rocks are said by Mr. Blatchley to occur
on its east flank, a few miles south of Austin; these rocks contain fossils,
which, however, are nearly obliterated by metamorphism. A box of these,
forwarded some time since, has never been received, so that no positive statement
can be made as to the age of the formation. From Mr. Blatchley’s
description of the forms observed by him, it would appear that we may have
here rocks older than the Carboniferous.</p>

<p>East of the 116th meridian, our collections indicate the existence of a broad
area covered chiefly by rocks of Carboniferous age, which seem to occupy
most of the space between the 115th and 116th meridians. The most western
locality of Carboniferous fossils known to us is that on the west side of Diamond
Valley, about 70 miles east of Austin, and in lon. 116°. Here, in a dark,
crystalline limestone, a variety of species have been obtained by Mr. Clayton,
all in a poor state of preservation, but of which the Carboniferous age may be
without difficulty made out. Among the genera represented at this locality are
<i>Productus</i>—two species, one of which is <i>P. semireticulatus</i>—<i>Spirifer</i>, and
<i>Fusulina</i>, probably <i>F. gracilis</i>, besides some indistinctly marked corals. The
indications are that these beds are of Lower Carboniferous age. On the east
side of Diamond Valley some imperfectly preserved corals have been found,
probably Devonian, or possibly belonging to a still older group. The collections
from the region included between the 115th and 116th meridians indicate the
association of rocks of both Devonian and Carboniferous age in the outcrops.
Here our collections do not enable us to do anything more than to corroborate
the previously published statements of Messrs. Meek and Engelmann in regard
to the age of the formations.</p>

<p>From the Silver Peak District, near lon. 117° 20´, and lat. 38°, an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
collection of fossils has been brought by Mr. Clayton. The specimens are
unfortunately in a very imperfect and fragmentary condition, but they contain
the first trilobites which have been brought to our office from any of the Pacific
States or Territories. The rock in which they occur is a dark yellowish brown
limestone, with intercalated layers of light grey argillaceous shales. Some of
them appear to belong to the genus <i>Dalmania</i>, and, if so, the formation is
probably of Upper Silurian age, although possibly Devonian. The careful
examination of the corals which have been obtained in this district by Mr.
Clayton, and also by Mr. Blatchley, will probably throw some additional light
on the geological position of these rocks.</p>

no Carboniferous fossils have yet been found in that part of Nevada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dall made some remarks on the shells which have been collected
by various naturalists at and near Monterey.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He remarked that he himself had collected in two weeks no less than two
hundred and nineteen species, which number, added to forty-four which have
been previously reported as occurring there, but which he did not obtain, gives
two hundred and sixty-three as the whole number of species of shells now
known to have been found at Monterey.</p>

<p>Of these were previously obtained only to the south of Monterey, twenty-four;
previously obtained only to the north of Monterey, forty-two; previously
obtained to north and south, but not at Monterey, twenty-nine; previously
obtained at Monterey, one hundred and one; not obtained by Mr. Dall, forty-four;
new, or not reported, twenty-three.</p>

<p>Collections of shells are greatly needed from points between San Francisco
and the mouth of the Columbia river, and also from points between San Diego
and Cape St. Lucas, in order to determine questions of geographical distribution.</p>

<p>A curious fact was noticed in <i>Chiton scabra</i>, of Reeve, which, although belonging
to a class of strictly marine animals, was observed clinging to the rocks
beyond the reach, except in storms, of the highest spray. That it does not
migrate is proved by the fact that, living in nooks and crevices of the rocks,
it grows into the very form of the hole in which it lives.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall also mentioned that, having visited and thoroughly searched the
original locality for <i>Helix Californiensis</i>, a small island off Point Cypress,
accessible only at low tide, this species was found to be nearly exterminated.
A letter received from Dr. Canfield of Monterey since the visit of Mr. Dall,
confirms the fact of the extinction. This has been caused apparently by a large
millipede, which exists in great numbers, and is extremely voracious.</p>

<p>Several of the shells found commonly at Monterey, are identical with others
collected during the past season on the coast of Russian North America.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Whitney made some remarks on the absence of the
Northern Drift formation from the western coast of North America
and from the interior of the continent, throughout the region to
the southwest of the Missouri River.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The term “Northern Drift” is understood to include the masses of unstratified
detrital materials and boulders which have been transported and distributed
by some general cause independent, in a great degree, of the present conformation
of the surface and of the direction of the existing river courses. The
investigations of geologists have shown that the surface of Canada, New England,
and the States north of the Ohio and north of the parallel of 39°, as far
west as the Mississippi, and even for some distance beyond it in that direction,
are covered by detrital materials which have been carried from the North
towards the South, and often for a great distance and in immense masses.</p>

<p>The explorations of the Geological Survey of California have demonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
however, that there is no true Northern Drift within the limits of this State.
Our detrital materials, which often form deposits of great extent and thickness,
are invariably found to have been dependent for their origin and present position
on causes similar to those now in action, and to have been deposited on
the flanks and at the bases of the nearest mountain ranges by currents of water
rushing down their slopes. While we have abundant evidence of the former
existence of extensive glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, there is no reason to suppose
that this ice was to any extent an effective agent in the transportation of
the superficial detritus now resting on the flanks of the mountains. The glaciers
were confined to the most elevated portions of the mountains, and although the
moraines which they have left as evidences of their former extension are often
large and conspicuous, they are insignificant in comparison with the detrital
masses formed by aqueous erosion. There is nothing anywhere in California
which indicates a general glacial epoch during which ice covered the whole
country and moved bodies of detritus over the surface, independently of its
present configuration, as is seen throughout the Northeastern States.</p>

<p>The same condition of things prevails in Nevada and through Oregon, as
far as explored by the members of the Survey. The detritus seems always to
be accumulated at the base of the mountains—gravel, boulders, and sand lying
below and not far distant from the beds of rock of which these materials once
formed a part, and from which they appear to have been detached by weathering
and aqueous erosion.</p>

<p>From the observations of Messrs. Ashburner and Dall, it would appear that
no evidences of Northern Drift have yet been detected on this Coast, even as
far north as British Columbia or Russian America. Neither of these gentlemen
has observed any indication of a transportation of drift materials from the
north towards the south, or of any condition of things similar to that which
must have existed in the Eastern States during the diluvial epoch.</p>

<p>On examining the published records of explorers in the central portion of the
Continent, it will be noticed that there is strong reason to believe that the
absence of the Northern drift formation is not peculiar to the States along the
Pacific Coast; but that the whole region west of the Rocky Mountains is also
destitute of any indications of a detrital formation moved over the surface in one
direction by any great general cause. Judging from our present stock of evidence,
I am inclined to draw the line which limits the Northern Drift formation
on the south and west approximately from the mouth of the Ohio to the headwaters
of the Saskatchewan River.</p>

<p>It is evident that these facts should be taken into account in theorizing on
the origin and cause of the drift. If, as stated above, the transporting agent
has been limited in its field of action to the eastern and northeastern portion of
our Continent, the phenomenon is seen at once to have become, in a measure, a
local one—at least much more local than has hitherto been usually assumed by
those geologists who have adopted the glacier theory of the drift.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Whitney remarked that he was particularly desirous
of introducing the subject on this occasion, in order that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
have an opportunity of impressing on Mr. Dall, who is about to
leave for the Northern Coast, on the Telegraph Expedition, the
importance of making a thorough examination of the detrital
formations and surface geology of the country he may traverse.</p>

<h3>List of Shells collected at Baulines Bay, California, June, 1866.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ROBT. E. C. STEARNS, CURATOR OF CONCHOLOGY, CAB. ACAD. NAT. SCIENCES.</p>

<p>The comparative scantiness of molluscan life in the immediate vicinity of
San Francisco, and of the coast for many miles in a southerly direction, led me
to believe that an exploration of the small bays to the north of the Golden
Gate would reveal a very considerable increase both of species and individuals;
accordingly, upon the 14th, 23d, and 24th of last June, I visited the small inlet
known as Baulines Bay, and made an examination of the sandspit which makes
out from its southerly shore, also the beach inside of and as far north as Duxbury
reef, which latter connects with the coast at a point about a mile above
the entrance to the bay. The unfavorable condition of the tides prevented an
exploration of the reef; as most of the specimens were obtained from the drift,
without doubt the following list can be largely increased by a more thorough
examination of the locality, especially the reef, at extreme low water and at
different seasons of the year.</p>

<p>All of the specimens were in a condition sufficiently perfect to make identification
easy; a few forms, of which I had some doubt, were submitted to Dr.
J. G. Cooper.</p>

<h3>Notice of a Human Skull, recently taken from a Shaft near
Angel’s, Calaveras County.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. D. WHITNEY.</p>

<p>This skull was taken from a shaft sunk on a mining claim at Altaville, near
Angel’s, in Calaveras County, by Mr. James Matson. By him it was given to
Mr. Scribner, of Angel’s, and by Mr. Scribner to Dr. Jones. Mr. Matson
states that the skull was found at a depth of about one hundred and thirty
feet, in a bed of gravel five feet in thickness, above which are four beds of
consolidated volcanic ash, locally known as “lava”; these volcanic beds are separated
from each other by layers of gravel, and Mr. Matson gives the following
as the section of the various deposits passed through in sinking the shaft,
which is one hundred and fifty-three feet deep, to the bed rock:</p>

<p>The skull was found, according to Mr. Matson, in bed number 8, just above
the lowest stratum of lava. With the skull were found fragments of silicified
wood, the whole being covered and partly incrusted with stony matter, so that
the fact of its being a skull was not recognized until after it had passed into
Mr. Scribner’s hands, by whom it was cleaned and presented to Dr. Jones.</p>

<p>The skull is said by Mr. Matson to have been taken from the shaft February
25th, 1866, and it came into my hands in the July following, when I immediately
proceeded to the locality; but found the shaft temporarily abandoned and
partly filled with water, so that it was impossible at that time to make any farther
search in the bed from which the skull was procured. A careful inquiry
into all the circumstances of the alleged discovery, and an interview with all
the persons who had been in any way connected with it, impressed upon my
mind the conviction that the facts were as stated above, and that there was
every reason to believe that the skull really came from the position assigned to
it by Mr. Matson. Still, as it is evidently highly desirable that as large an
amount of evidence as possible should be accumulated in regard to a discovery
of so much importance, I made arrangements that I should be notified
whenever the shaft was reopened and the water taken out, and hope at a future
meeting to be able to lay before the Academy the results of a personal examination
of this interesting locality, and of further excavations in the bed from
which the skull was taken.</p>

<p>Assuming the correctness of Mr. Matson’s statements, this relic of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
antiquity is easily seen to be an object of the greatest interest to the ethnologist
as well as the geologist. The previous investigations of the Geological
Survey have clearly demonstrated the fact that man was contemporaneous with
the mastodon and elephant, since the works of his hands have been repeatedly
found in such connection with the bones of these animals that it would be impossible
to account for the facts observed on any other theory. (See Geology
of California, Vol. I, p. 252.) But in the case of the skull now laid before
the Academy, the geological position to which it must be assigned is, apparently,
still lower than that of the mastodon, since the remains of this animal,
as well as the elephant, which are so abundantly scattered over this State, are
always (so far as our observations yet extend) limited in their position to the
superficial deposits, and have never been found at any considerable depth below
the surface. There is every reason to believe that these great proboscidians
lived at a very recent date, (geologically speaking) and posterior to the epoch
of the existence of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, and also after the close of
the period of activity of the now extinct volcanoes of that great chain. In
fact, they belong to the present epoch. The bed, on the other hand, in which
this skull was found, must have been deposited at a time when the volcanoes of
the Sierra were still in vigorous action, and, as seems to us highly probable
from a careful consideration of the geological structure of the region, previous
to the glacial epoch of the Sierra, and also previous to the erosion of the
cañons of the present rivers. No pains will be spared, however, to investigate
all the conditions of the occurrence of this skull, and they will be fully reported
on at a future time.</p>

<p>The portions of the skull which are preserved are, the frontal bone, the
nasal bone, the superior maxillary bone of the right side, the malar bones, a
part of the temporal bone of the left side, with the mastoid process and the
zygomatic process, and the whole of the orbits of both eyes. The base of the
skull is embedded in a mass of bone breccia and small pebbles of volcanic rock,
incrusted with a thin layer of carbonate of lime, which appears once to have
extended over the whole surface of the skull and of which a considerable portion
still remains, the rest having been removed apparently in the process of cleaning.
Under the malar bone of the left side, a snail shell is lodged, and partly
concealed by the breccia of bone wedged in the cavity. This shell is the <i>Helix
Mormonum</i>, according to Dr. Cooper, a species now living in the region where
the skull was obtained. Although not competent to express a decided opinion
on the subject of the ethnological relations of this skull, I should suppose that it
belonged to the type of the Indians now inhabiting the foot-hills of the Sierra.
It is certain that the facial angle is not one indicating a low order of intellect.
The skull, however, seems to have been very thick and solid. It will be placed
in the hands of competent craniologists for examination and description, as soon
as reliable information has been obtained with regard to its occurrence, or
whenever all has been ascertained that can be.</p>

<h3>Enumeration of the Californian species of Lycæna.</h3>

<p class="center">BY H. BEHR, M.D.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Lycæna</i> is much more extensively represented in California than
in the Atlantic States, where, with the exception of a few Arctic species,
only the most cosmopolitan types are represented, such as that of <i>Argiolus</i> and
that of <i>Amyntas</i>.</p>

<p>California has about the same number of species as a corresponding area in
the Mediterranean basin. The species are never identical with gerontogeic forms;
but there is scarcely a single European type that does not find its analogue on
the Pacific coast: a circumstance of which the celebrated lepidopterologist,
Dr. Boisduval, has made good use in naming many Californian species with
reference to the best known European species of the same type, thus:</p>

<p>Alæ subtus cinereæ, linea discoidali serieque punctorum atrorum, halone

pallidiores quam puncta seriei et lineæ discoidalis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>This species is the only Californian yet known that approaches the type of
the European species <i>L. Arion</i>, <i>L. Euphemus</i>, <i>L. Iolas</i>, <i>L. Alcon</i>, <i>L. Erebus</i>.
It approaches most nearly to <i>L. Alcon</i> of Europe, and is intermediate between
that and the European <i>L. Acis</i>.</p>

<p>The only habitat of this species yet known to me, is in the Contra Costa
Coast Range, in the vicinity of San Antonio, where it frequents steep, grassy
hill-sides. It is found at the end of May and beginning of June, and is rather
rare.</p>

<h4>2. <i>L. Antiacis</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>May. Different localities.</p>

<h4>3. <i>L. Xerxes</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>May. Lone Mountain, near San Francisco; rather
rare.</p>

<p>There exists no European analogue to this very peculiar type.</p>

<h4>4. <i>L. Piasus</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>Very common throughout middle California. It replaces
the Atlantic <i>L. Pseudargiolus</i>, and <i>L. neglecta</i>, Edw., as well as the
European <i>L. Argiolus</i>; and belongs to one of the most cosmopolitan types
of the genus. The caterpillar feeds on the flowers of the <i>Pavia</i>, unlike its
European representative, which feeds on the leaves of <i>Rhamnus frangula</i>.</p>

<h4>5. <i>L. Pheres</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>May and June. Lone Mountain, near San Francisco.
I do not know of any other locality.</p>

<h4>6. <i>L. Heteronea</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>Several localities. May and June. Likes to
repose on <i>Eriogonum</i>, and is only to be found where some species of this genus
is abundant. Probably the caterpillar feeds on the flower of this plant. This
species is a very fine analogue of the <i>L. Daphnis</i> of Europe.</p>

<h4>7. <i>L. Lorquini</i>, Behr.</h4>

<p>Alæ ♂ ris et ♀ næ superne fuscæ, a radice ultra medium pruina cærulea
obtectæ, limbo tessellato. Alæ ♀ næ vitta marginali pallide fulvescenti
instructæ.</p>

<p>Alæ subtus cinereæ, anticæ puncto duplici radicali, linea discoidali serieque
punctorum necnon lunulis marginalibus instructæ; posticæ macula alba pro
linea discoidali signatæ vittaque alba quæ occupat spatium inter seriem punctorum
et lunulas marginales.</p>

<p>I possess a pair of this <i>Lycæna</i>, through the kindness of our celebrated
entomologist, Mr. Lorquin, who caught the species in the higher Sierra Nevada.</p>

<h4>8. <i>L. Icarioides</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>May and June, Marin County.</p>

<h4>9. <i>L. Dædalus</i>, Behr.</h4>

<p>Icarioidi similis sed subtus, quæ puncta in Icarioide sunt rotundissima, in
Dædalo sunt transverse producta, lineaque discoidalis alarum posticarum,
quæ in Icarioide deest et pro qua macula alba subtriquetra militat, hac in specie
linea transversa distinctissime nigra vindicatur.</p>

<p>The three specimens in my collection, I received through the kindness of Mr.
Chas. Hoffman, of the Geological Survey, who collected them in the Alpine
regions around the head waters of the Tuolumne River.</p>

<h4>10. <i>L. Sæpiolus</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<h4>11. <i>L. Aehaja</i>, Behr.</h4>

<p>Alæ utriusque sexus supra fuscæ, margine lineaque discoidali nigriscente,
vittaque fulva marginali signatæ ♀ næ magis obscuræ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Alæ subtus cinereæ, linea discoidali serieque punctorum nigrorum dilutius
cinctorum refracta signatæ. Posticæ punctis tribus nigris dilutius cinctis radicalibus
insuper instructæ. Lunularum series duplex, interior nigra exterior
dilutior, apicem versus analem puncta nonnulla aurantiaca amplectens.</p>

<p>This species I received also from Mr. Hoffmann, who found it associated with
<i>L. Dædalus</i>. It is the Californian analogue of the European <i>Agestis</i>, and produces
on one somewhat the impression of a Polyommatus.</p>

<h4>12. <i>L. Cilia</i>, Behr.</h4>

<p>Alæ ♂ supra argenteo glaucæ, anticæ margine fusca lata, posticæ angusta
instructæ; anticæ linea discoidali posticæ serie punctorum marginali, cui intus
lunulæ submarginales præcedunt signatæ. Limbus subtessellatus.</p>

<p>Alæ ♀ næ fuscæ æque ac ♂ ris signatæ. Limbus distincte tessellatus.</p>

<p>Alæ ♂ ris anticæ subtus albidæ linea discoidali, serie punctorum necnon
puncto radicali duplici ornatæ; lunulæ marginales duplices; posticæ a radice
ad seriem punctorum cinereæ, punctis tribus radicalibus, serieque punctorum
nigrorum lactea cinctorum, maculaque discoidali lactea ornatæ; a serie punctorum
usque ad marginem alæ posticæ lacteæ, serie lunularum duplici versus
angulum analem luteo tincta instructæ.</p>

<p>♀ næ alæ subtus æque signatæ ac ♂ ris sed anticæ æque ad posticæ dimidiatæ
et quæ pars est cinerea in ♂ colore fusco obtegitur.</p>

<p>This species I also received from the Geological Survey. It was found at an
elevation of 11,000 feet and over, on the snowy heights surrounding the headwaters
of the Tuolumne River. It belongs to the type of the European <i>Orbitulus</i>,
which is found in similar regions of the Alps.</p>

<h4>13. <i>L. Argyrotoxus</i>, Behr.</h4>

<p>Alæ ♂ cinctæ supra lilacinæ fusco marginatæ albo limbatæ, ♂ næ supra
fuscæ, in anticis fascia in posticis lunulis marginalibus fulvis signatæ.</p>

<p>Alæ ♀ ris subtus albidæ, ♀ næ lacteæ. Linea discoidalis parum distincta.
Series punctorum vix halone cinctorum in anticis stricta, in posticis refracta.
Pars radicalis anticarum concolor, posticarum nonnullis punctis minimis sed
distincte halone cinctis signata; lunularum series marginalium duplex sed
parum distincta, spatia fulva amplectens, quæ tamen non semper distingui
possunt, in posticis lunulæ exteriores seriei splendore metallico micantes.</p>

<p>Alæ ♀ næ subtus magis distincte signatæ; spatia fulva submarginalia nec
non splendor metallicus lunularum distinctius videtur.</p>

<p>This species is found in the Sierra Nevada. It is very similar to <i>L. Scudderi</i>
of the Atlantic coast, and may prove to be only a local variety of that species,
from which it differs chiefly in the shape and arrangement of the submarginal
markings, which, however, in the Atlantic coast specimens, are much more distinct
than in those from California.</p>

<h4>14. <i>L. Calchas.</i></h4>

<p>♂? Alæ ♀ næ supra fuscæ radicem versus pruina cærulea abductæ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
anticæ linea discoidali, posticæ punctis marginalibus nigrescentibus, lunulisque
submarginalibus fulvis signatæ.</p>

<p>Alæ subtus cinereæ, linea discoidali, serieque punctorum quadrangularium
albo marginatorum signatæ. Lunularum series submarginalis duplex,
lunulas fulvas includens, in posticis intus triangulis albis suffulta. Lunulas
marginales in posticis metallice micant.</p>

<p>Of this species I possess only one specimen; but this differs so much from
the other California Lycænæ, that I consider myself justified in giving a
diagnosis of it, although, as a rule, descriptions of Lepidoptera belonging to
complicated and difficult groups should not be given without ample material on
which to base them.</p>

<p>This specimen is from Mono Lake, and was collected by the Geological
Survey.</p>

<h4>15. <i>L. Battoides.</i></h4>

<p>Alæ ♂ ris supra azureæ, late nigro marginatæ tessellato limbatæ, ♀ næ
fuscæ, posticæ lunulis nonnullis fulvis submarginalibus instructæ, omnium
limbus tessellatus.</p>

<p>Alæ utriusque sexus subtus albidæ, punctis radicalibus duobus, in anticis in
fasciam transversam valde refractam nigram confluentibus, linea discoidali, serie
punctorum ordinariorum quadrangularium nigrorum, duplici serie submarginali,
necnon margine nigro instructæ. Alæ posticæ tribus punctis radicalibus
nigris et ad seriem punctorum submarginalium internam fascia fulva ornatæ,
quæ nec seriem punctorum externam neque apicem anteriorem attingit.</p>

<p>This species was collected at an elevation of eleven thousand feet, on the
head-waters of the San Joaquin River, by the Geological Survey. It represents
the European <i>L. Battus</i>.</p>

<h4>16. <i>L. Enoptes</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>Hills near the Mission Dolores, and in the San
Bruno Hills. This species is rather rare. It represents the European <i>L. Aegon</i>.</p>

<h4>17. <i>L. Antægon</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>The most common species near San Francisco,
and found nearly everywhere through Central California. There are several
generations succeeding each other through the year. A specimen I received
from the head-waters of the San Joaquin River differs somewhat from this; but
as I have only one of this variety, I will not venture to express a decided opinion
in regard to it. It is, perhaps, an Alpine variety, and corresponding with
a similar one of <i>L. Sæpiolus</i>, of which I received several specimens forming a
series of transitions from the common type.</p>

<h4>18.</h4>

<p>There is a species approaching the European <i>L. Agestis</i>, and which I
received from the head-waters of the San Joaquin River; but the specimens in
my possession are too imperfect to allow of an accurate description being given.</p>

<h4>19. <i>L. Amyntula</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>From the Contra Costa hills, where, in May and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
June, it frequents the flowers of the Pavia, on which the caterpillar probably
feeds, as does that of <i>L. Piasus</i>.</p>

<h4>20. <i>L. exilis</i>, Boisd.</h4>

<p>This species is rare, and so small that it might easily
be overlooked. It frequents low meadows and salt marshes, where it loves to
repose on the succulent stems of Salicornia, and on the flowers of Frankenia.
At present it seems to be the only Californian representative of <i>L. Telicanus</i>
and <i>Boeticus</i> of Europe; but I think that several species of this type will be
found in Southern California, when that part of the State has been better
examined. I have a specimen of <i>L. exilis</i>, collected by Baron de Terloo, in
the Sierra Madre, between Mazatlan and Durango; and I received, from the
same gentleman, several species of the same type from that locality.</p>

<p>It is this type which is so numerously represented in the tropical regions of
the old world, and also in extra-tropical Australia. Our depauperated species,
<i>L. exilis</i>, with its two European congeners, are, so far as I know, the only ones
of this type which are found in the northern hemisphere beyond the tropics.</p>

<p>All the other Californian species belong to types of the temperate zone, and
are such as are rarely met with in tropical countries, or in the southern hemisphere
even out of the tropics. The type of <i>Amyntula</i> is the only one which has a
series of species in tropical Asia; but, as far as I know, none in tropical
America. The type of <i>Piasus</i>, also, has some representatives in the tropics of
both continents, one of them being even identified with a species of Southern
Europe.</p>

<p>As to the other types, these species are essentially endemic; and even among
the Arctic species there seems not to be any amphigeic one. As the males vary
very little, and the females only on their upper side, there is little difficulty in
transcribing and recognizing them. If among our species there is any one which
is identical with an Atlantic one, it is probably Argyrotoxus, which may be a
local modification of <i>L. Scudderi</i>, Edw.</p>

<h3>Notice of the Occurrence of a Tungstate of Lime and Copper
in Lower California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. D. WHITNEY.</p>

<p>Among some specimens brought from the vicinity of La Paz, Lower California,
by Mr. Rémond, about three years since, was one which attracted my
attention, as it seemed to contain an undescribed mineral. I therefore made
an analysis of it and found it to consist of tungstic acid, oxide of copper, and
lime, with a small quantity of water, probably not essential to its composition.
The results of the analysis were as follows:</p>

<table summary="Composition of the samples">
  <tr>
    <td>Tungstic Acid</td>
    <td class="tdr">79.69</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oxide of Copper</td>
    <td class="tdr">6.77</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lime</td>
    <td class="tdr">10.95</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Protoxide of Iron</td>
    <td class="tdr">.31</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Water</td>
    <td class="tdr">1.40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="tdr total">99.12</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>On examining to ascertain if there was any known mineral having a composition
similar to this, I found that a tungstate of lime containing copper had
been described by Domeyko as occurring in the copper mines of Llamuco, near
Chuapa, in the province of Coquimbo, in Chili, where it was discovered by M.
Gay (Annales des Mines (4) iii, 15). That mineral, however, only contained
3.3 per cent. of oxide of copper, while the one of which the analysis is given
above contains 6.77 per cent. of that substance. M. Domeyko calls the mineral
analyzed by him “Scheelin calcaire cuivreux,” but does not attempt to give
a formula for it, or to decide whether it is entitled to rank as a distinct species.</p>

<p>The Lower California mineral, of which the analysis is given above, occurs
in a red metamorphic rock, associated with black tourmaline. It is crystalline-granular
in structure, with a distinct cleavage in one direction, and seems to be
homogeneous throughout. Its hardness is about that of Scheelite; luster, highly
vitreous; streak, very light greenish-gray; color, pistachio green, passing to
olive and leek green. Before the blowpipe in the glass tube it blackens,
and gives off a little water. On charcoal it blackens instantly, becomes
rounded on the edges, with a little intumescence, and gradually acquires the
appearance of a slag, in which numerous fine points of metallic copper are seen.
With the fluxes it gives the reactions of tungstic acid and copper. It is easily
dissolved by chlorohydric acid, with separation of tungstic acid.</p>

<p>From the appearance of the mineral, I am inclined to regard it as having a
definite composition, represented by the formula CuO WO₃+2 (CaO WO₃);
this formula would require the following composition:</p>

<table summary="Composition of the samples">
  <tr>
    <td>Tungstic Acid</td>
    <td class="tdr">78.43</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oxide of Copper</td>
    <td class="tdr">8.95</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lime</td>
    <td class="tdr">12.62</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="tdr total">100.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>This agrees pretty well with the results of the analysis, although it is desirable
that more specimens should be examined, and if possible from other localities.
I am informed by Mr. Ashburner that he has noticed this mineral at
more than one mine in Lower California.</p>

<p>At all events, I would suggest for the mineral in question the name of
<i>Cuproscheelite</i>, as convenient for designating it, and as expressing its chemical
and mineralogical relations, whether it be considered as a mineral substance
having a distinct and fixed composition, or only as a variety of Scheelite, containing
a large but uncertain amount of oxide of copper.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Ayres called attention to the fact that a carcase of a Black
fish could be procured at the Potrero, at a small expense, and a
subscription was raised for its purchase.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney exhibited a branch of <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>,
taken from a small tree growing near San Rafael, of which the
leaves are entirely white. The tree presents a very singular
appearance, surrounded as it is by other redwoods of the usual
color. The fact was elicited that similar blanched redwoods exist
in other localities in the Coast Ranges; but no explanation or
theory was offered to account for this curious, abnormal blanching
of the foliage of a single species—a similar condition of things not
having been noticed, so far as known, in any other species than the
redwood.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notices.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM P. BLAKE,<br />
Professor of Mineralogy, Geology, and Mining, Dept. Sci. Coll. of California.</p>

<h4>I. NEW LOCALITY OF FOSSILS IN THE GOLD-BEARING ROCKS OF CALIFORNIA.</h4>

<p>I have obtained specimens of <i>Ammonites</i> from the cut in the rocks on the
line of the Central Pacific Railroad, about two miles below Colfax, and in the
heart of the main gold belt of the State.</p>

<p>The rock is a compact argillite, somewhat altered and much discolored by
the peroxydation of iron. The strata are boldly flexed and are interstratified
with coarse grits and a thick bed of conglomerate, so much altered that the
pebbles are homogeneously cemented.</p>

<p>The substance of the fossils has been removed by percolating waters, but very
perfect casts of them remain and show the details of the external form, but do
not permit the septæ to be seen. It is thus not possible, perhaps, to determine
the specific characters; and considering, also, the absence of a typical collection
and works of reference, I do not attempt a minute description, preferring to
refer the specimens to a palæontologist. It may, however, be observed that
the fossils are undoubtedly of the secondary period; and that they are apparently
specifically identical with those from the American river, in the same vicinity,
of which I sent photographs to Mr. Meek, at the Smithsonian Institution, in
1863, and afterwards noticed at one of the meetings of this Academy, in September,
1864. They are, also, apparently identical with the species found in
the Bear Valley, Mariposa, slates. If this species has not been already named,
I desire to connect with it the name of Mr. Spear, in whose cabinet at Georgetown,
the earliest specimen was carefully preserved. I obtained one specimen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the locality, and another was presented to me by Mr. Richard Carroll, it having
been saved by the quarry-men, under the impression that it was a petrified
rattlesnake. It is about six inches in its longest diameter, being elliptical and
evidently distorted by lateral pressure.</p>

<h4>II. TOOTH OF THE EXTINCT ELEPHANT, PLACER COUNTY.</h4>

<p>I have received from Mr. Baker and Mr. Thompson, through the hands of
Mr. E. Tyler, all of Placer County, a single molar tooth of <i>Elephas</i> found in
the auriferous gravel near Michigan Bluffs, thus adding another locality to the
list showing the former general distribution of the ancient elephants over this
coast.</p>

<h4>III. SHARK TEETH AND OTHER MARINE REMAINS, TULARE COUNTY.</h4>

<p>When at Ocoya or Posa Creek, in 1853, I collected a great number of shark
teeth from the tops of the hills, at the base of the Sierra Nevada, on the east
side of the Tulare Lake. These were described and figured in my Report to
the U. S. Government. Having recently revisited that region, I found other
localities, and made another collection, a part of which I now exhibit to the
Academy. The following genera and species are represented: <i>Oxyrhina plana</i>,
<i>O. tumula</i>, <i>Lamna clavata</i>, <i>Galeocerdo productus</i>, <i>Prionodon antiquus</i>, <i>Hemipristis
heteropleurus</i>, <i>Notidanus</i>, (Nov. Sp.?) and <i>Zygobates</i>, a genus of the
family of Skates, having pavement-like teeth. Vertebratæ, apparently of the
whale, are abundant, and some fragments of the head. These remains are now
at least twelve hundred feet above the sea, and being in unbroken horizontal
strata, show a very great and general uplift of the region in comparative late
times. The strata were referred to the Miocene in my Report, but I am now
inclined to regard them as Post-Pliocene. It is interesting to note that these
strata rest undisturbed upon granite, which is traversed by gold-bearing veins,
not over five miles from the point where the fossils are found, and so low that
the veins must have been covered by the sea prior to the elevation of the region.</p>

<h4>IV. QUARRY OF GOLD-BEARING ROCK.</h4>

<p>The Baker or Whiskey Hill Mine of Placer County, a few miles from Lincoln,
presents the novelty of profitable gold mining from a <i>quarry</i> in the slates
without any well defined quartz vein. A hill with a rounded outline is covered
with rough outcrops of rusty slate, over a breadth of two hundred feet or more.
A quarry at one end exposes the slate, with a great variety of colors, from white
to brown and red and black, the whole of it being soft and ochraceous, and in
places stained green and blue with carbonate of copper. These variegated
slates are like those commonly known, among California copper prospectors, as
“calico rocks,” and the ground was first located and prospected for copper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident that the formation consists of beds of iron pyrites (mundic)
with a small but variable portion of copper pyrites, and that the rusty, upper
portions are due to the gradual decomposition of the sulphurets above the permanent
water-line, or where the atmosphere has had access. Below the water-line
we may not expect to find the rusty ochrey slates. This is shown, also, at
a shaft which has reached the water. Blocks of mundic, taken out of that shaft,
are interstratified with talcose slate. At one point, in the bottom of the quarry,
a layer of green and blue carbonate of copper is found, and this is evidently the
result of a gradual concentration of the copper from the decomposed ground
above. The soft slate, as quarried, is trammed to a five-stamp mill, with very
coarse grates, and nearly forty tons are run through it daily. The pay is said to
vary from two to twenty dollars, but the average is reported to be from five to
six dollars per ton.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Stearns read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Since my communication to the Academy of date July 16th last, on the
Shells of Baulines Bay, additional specimens (4) of <i>Haliotis rufescens</i> have
been found by Mr. Harford and Dr. Kellogg; also many specimens of <i>Katherina
tunicata</i>, and one of <i>Mopalia Hindsii</i>; from between the umbos of very
large specimens of <i>Mytilus Californianus</i>, collected by the same gentlemen,
several specimens of <i>Barleia? subtenuis</i> Carp.</p>

<p>In addition to the above marine forms, the following species were found by
the same parties in a gulch at Belvidere Ranch, not far from Capt. Morgan’s
house, south side of Baulines Bay: <i>Helix Nickliniana</i>, <i>H. arrosa</i>, <i>H. infumata</i>,
<i>H. Columbiana</i> (hirsute var.) and <i>H. Vancouverensis</i>. Also, near a small
stream on the same ranch, <i>Bythinella Binneyi</i>, Tryon. The last named species
had previously been found in this neighborhood by Rev. J. Rowell.</p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Blake mentioned that a tooth of a mastodon had been
found about three miles from Antioch, near Monte Diablo, by Capt.
Stevens.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns gave an account of the Helix, its anatomy, geographical
distribution, and use as an article of food and for medicinal
purposes, in both ancient and modern times.</p>

<p>Prof. Blake stated that he had in his possession a portion of a
human skull said to have been taken from a depth of 250 feet
below the surface, near Columbia, in Tuolumne County.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Regular Meeting, September 3d, 1866.</span></h2>

<p class="center">President in the chair.</p>

<p>Twelve members present, and Mr. A. Wood as a visitor.</p>

<p>Mr. John Swett was elected a Resident Member.</p>

<p>Donations to the Cabinet: Two specimens of fishes from Dr.
Kellogg and Dr. Behr; specimen of a fungus, <i>Polyporus igniarius</i>,
from Dr. Kellogg.</p>

<p>Dr. Kellogg called the attention of the Academy to the remarkable
specimen of fungus presented by him, <i>Polyporus igniarius</i>,
which was found growing upon the Bay tree, <i>Oreodaphne Californica</i>;
and gave a description of <i>Fungi</i> in general; alluding particularly
to the destructive effect of many species, some producing
the dry rot in ships, others destroying buildings, producing the
disintegration of mortar in masonry, and seriously affecting the
health, or destroying animal life.</p>

<p>Dr. Kellogg also remarked on the use of some species of Fungi
for food, particularly by the natives of Australia, who regard them
with especial favor for that purpose. The rapid growth and poisonous
effect of certain species of Fungi were mentioned, also the
use made of some species in the arts.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Wood, who has recently returned from a botanical exploration
of Oregon, being present as a visitor, was invited to
speak, and gave the following narrative of the recent ascent of
Mount Hood, by himself and a party of gentlemen:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On the 20th of August last, in company with Dr. Atkinson, of Portland,
and the Rev. J. Deardorff, of Walla Walla, and three others, I stood upon the
summit of Mount Hood in Oregon. From our last camp on the summit of the
Cascade Range to this point, the summit of Mount Hood is eleven miles of
constant and weary ascent, at angles about as follows: Five miles in the first,
12 to 15°; two miles to eternal snow, 25 to 30°; one and one-half miles to the
gap in the rim of the crater, about 45°; the remaining ascent traversing the
ancient crater, nearly or quite 60°! The day was cloudless; a strong, warm
wind from the southeast softened the surface of the snow and favored our
ascent, although it gave us much anxiety lest it should loosen some of the
tremendous acclivities of snow and overhanging drifts from above us.</p>

<p>Starting from camp at daylight, on horseback four miles, we arrived at the
top at a quarter past two <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, in nine and a half hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Our apparatus for measuring the heights consisted of two barometers, (aneroid)
a thermometer, a tin cup, and a spirit lamp. Both barometers failed us,
the index ceasing to turn after something more than a complete revolution on
the dial. They were not made for such heights. But we made good use of our
thermometer.</p>

<p>The ascent was exceedingly difficult, and not without danger. The long
summer heat had undermined the snows, causing their surface to conform more
to the ruggedness of the mountains, and the slides had opened chasms of invisible
depths across our path. We looked down into several of these chasms and
saw that the massive walls below consisted of solid, blue ice, and terminated at
length in the blackness of darkness. We could hear the noise of running
water, apparently in torrents. One of these chasms was unavoidable—<i>and must
be crossed</i>. Its transverse length was nearly a mile, and its width from ten to one
hundred feet. By the aid of a rope, forty-five yards in length, and five pike-poles,
each eight feet, we crossed, (of course at the narrowest place) and afterward
by rope and poles, tugging, panting, dizzy, we dragged ourselves up to
the terrific crest of this Mountain Monarch.</p>

<p>The summit area is of very limited dimensions—a crescent in shape, half a
mile in length, and <i>three</i> to forty or fifty feet in width. It is a fearful place, as
it is the imminent brow of a precipice on the north, sheer down not less than a
vertical mile of bare columnar rock!</p>

<p>This height is lifted so far above all other heights (except the four distant
snow-clad peaks to the north and Mount Jefferson on the south) that the
country beneath seemed depressed to a uniform level, and the horizon retreated
to the distance of more than two hundred miles, including nearly all Oregon
and Washington Territory. The sublimity and grandeur of that view I must
leave to the imagination of the reader. A cañon of enormous depth plunges
down along the southeast flank, and is filled in part by a glacier evidently in
motion, and having below a very abrupt termination. Terminal and lateral
<i>moraines</i> mark its course, and a torrent of water issues from beneath. While
we delayed here, an avalanche of rocks, an immense mass, started by the wind,
thundered down the left wall of this cañon several thousand feet, and its track
was marked by a trail of white smoke.</p>

<p>On the west side of the ancient crater, at the base of a vast craggy pinnacle
of rocks, (a portion of the ancient rim of the crater) is still an open abyss,
whence issue constantly volumes of a strongly sulphurous smoke. That there
is also heat there is evident from the immense depression of the snow about this
place—depressed not less than a thousand feet below the snows which fill to
the <i>brim</i> other portions of the ancient crater.</p>

<p>As I have already stated, we found our barometers useless in these vast
heights, and were reduced to the use of the thermometer alone. By this we
learned the boiling point of water at four several stations, as follows: At the
camp, the summit of the Cascade Range, it stood in boiling water at 204° Fah.
At the upper verge of the forest, it indicated 195½°. At the highest reach of
all apparent vegetation, 192°; and finally at the summit, where, after the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
persevering and determined efforts, (on account of the violence of the wind) we
at length, by means of a spirit lamp, changed a portion of snow to a cup of
boiling water, the mercury stood firm in the cup at 180°! These several
results being changed to <i>feet of elevation</i>, according to the rule universally approved
in such cases, indicate heights as follows, viz: At the summit of the
Cascade Range, and foot of Mt. Hood proper, 4,400 feet; at the limit of forest
trees, about 9,000 feet; at the highest limit of vegetation, 11,000 feet; at the
summit of the mountain, 17,600 feet.</p>

<p>We earnestly hope that these results may be hereafter tested by the barometer;
and by triangulation. Until then, we must adopt the estimate here
made, as the height of that sublime peak, and accord to Mount Hood the distinction
of being the highest land in the United States, if not the highest upon
the North American continent.</p>

<p><i>Hab.</i>—San Pedro, Cal., estuaries.</p>

<p>Only four specimens were found dead near the old landing, close to the mouth
of the bay, in October, 1861. I supposed them to be <i>P. brata Binn</i>, but they
are nearly three times as large, not lirate, etc. That species is catalogued by
Carpenter as among the collections from San Diego, in the Supp. Rep. etc.,
1863, pp. 612, 647, 673, but I do not find it in the State collection. Those described
are fresh and shining in the mouth—dull, but not much worn, outside.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting shell, being one of the links between the land and
marine mollusca—the species of the genus being chiefly tropical, occurring at
Cape St. Lucas, Panama, West Indies, Africa, and Isle of France, according to
Binney, who says that they inhabit crevices of rocks, especially those exposed
to the full force of the tide; but being pulmonate, they can probably live long
with but little moisture. On the rocks the living shell would be mistaken for
a <i>Lacuna</i> or <i>Littorina</i>, and the form of our species reminds one strongly of
<i>Succinea Oregonensis</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Behr made some remarks upon the <i>Lepidoptera</i> and the four
different stages of their development, noticing the fact that the
length of time of the egg state in some species, for instance the Chinese
silkworm, admits of the transportation of the same to foreign
countries, while in the Californian silkworm, <i>Saturnia ceanothi</i>, the
period of the egg state is so brief as to render it impossible to transport
the eggs either to New York or Europe. Dr. Behr also explained
the difference between the larva state in the <i>Lepidoptera</i>
and other classes of insects, and referred to the importance of the
larva condition in insects as a basis for classification, and mentioned
many interesting proofs of the tenacity of life during the <i>chrysalis</i>
or <i>pupa</i> state; alluding to the different classes of moths in which
wingless females occur, a peculiarity that is unknown to the butterflies.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander stated that in his “Remarks on California Trees,”
made at the meeting of October 16th, 1865, and published in the
current volume, (p. 225) he had referred a small pine growing
on the plains between Mendocino City and Noyo, to <i>Pinus murcata</i>;
but he could now state positively that it is the true <i>Pinus
contorta</i> of Douglas. He stated also, that No. 7, noticed on page
227 of that article, is <i>P. muricata</i>. Farther, on page 229,
<i>Quercus Wislizeni</i>, Englm. is wrongfully referred to <i>Q. agrifolia</i>.
<i>Q. Wislizeni</i> is a well characterized species with biennial fruit; the
fruit of <i>Q. agrifolia</i>, on the other hand, is annual. These two oaks
differ also materially in their distribution. <i>Q. Wislizeni</i> is found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
chiefly in the lower Sierra, and in the small valleys east of the redwoods
in Mendocino County. <i>Q. agrifolia</i> occurs almost exclusively
in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay, and on the banks of
streams emptying into it. It extends also southward, approaching
the coast more nearly as we reach Monterey.</p>

<h3>Mineralogical Notices.—No. II.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p><i>Kerargyrite.</i>—Chloride of silver in remarkably fine specimens occurs in the
“Poorman lode,” Idaho, associated with Proustite (light red silver ore), native
silver and native gold. Sheets of the chloride are taken out of the soft clay of
the vein, and are from one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch in thickness. It is
also found in irregular massive aggregations of crystals, in cubes, without any
modification, and over an eighth of an inch square. The color of my specimens
is brown, passing into violet blue in some portions.</p>

<p><i>Proustite.</i>—The “ruby silver” which occurs with the chloride in the Poorman
lode, as above, is often in masses of several ounces, or even pounds, in
weight, and it is reported to be occasionally seen in beautiful crystals, but none
have yet come under my observation.</p>

<p><i>Copper Glance</i>, <i>Red Oxide of Copper</i>, <i>Native Copper</i>.—These species are
found together in the “Red Cap claim,” Klamath County, California, in serpentine.
The metallic copper is seen in points throughout the massive sulphuret,
and is sometimes enveloped in red oxide. Both copper and oxide are most
abundant in the outer portions of the ore, as found, and they are apparently
formed by the gradual decomposition of the sulphuret.</p>

<p><i>Danaite.</i>—A cobaltic variety of mispickel is found associated with iron and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
copper pyrites at Meadow Lake, Nevada County, California. It is in distinct,
well formed, brilliant crystals, of a tin-white color, and about a quarter of an
inch in diameter. They are modified nearly as in fig. 289, Dana’s Min. This
mineral gives cobalt reactions before the blowpipe, and appears to contain a
large per centage of this metal. The ore is said to contain <i>nickel</i>, also, and is
being mined for shipment.</p>

<p><i>Cinnabar in Calcite.</i>—Cinnabar of a beautiful vermilion color is found in an
unusual form in Idaho, being abundantly spread through a gangue of massive,
compact limestone or marble. It is so compact and homogeneous that specimens
may be cut and polished like marble. There are no evidences in the ore that I
have received of the presence of other minerals, not even of quartz.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is my painful duty to inform the Academy of the decease of Robert
Kennicott. The meager information received furnishes no particulars, further
than that he died suddenly, in the month of May last, at Nulato Bay, in Russian
America.</p>

<p>The services rendered to science by Mr. Kennicott are worthy of something
more than a passing notice. In the month of May, in the year 1859, we find
him starting upon a prolonged exploration of Russian America, under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institute, assisted by the University of Michigan,
the Audubon Club of Chicago, and the Academy of Sciences of the same city.
This exploration, including also a portion of the territory held by the Hudson’s
Bay Company, extended from May, 1859, to the date of his return in October,
1862. From the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institute we learn that
“the route traversed by Mr. Kennicott was from Lake Superior along the
Kamenistiquoy River and Rainy and Winnipeg Lakes, up the Saskatchewan
River to Cumberland House; thence nearly north to Fort Churchill, on English
River, up the latter to Methy portage, at which point he first reached the head
waters of the streams flowing into the Arctic ocean; thence along the Clear
Water River and Athabasca Lake, down Peace River into Great Slave Lake,
and along the Mackenzie River to Fort Simpson. At this place Mr. Kennicott
spent a part of the first winter, making excursions up the Liard River to Fort
Liard in autumn, and again on snowshoes in January. Before the close of the
same winter he went up the Mackenzie to Big Island, and thence northwest to
Fort Rae, near the site of old Fort Providence. From this point he traveled
on the ice across Great Slave Lake to Fort Resolution, at the mouth of Peace
River, where he spent the summer of 1860. He next descended the Mackenzie
to Peel’s River, and thence proceeded westward across the Rocky Mountains
and down the Porcupine River to the Youkon, in the vicinity of which he
spent the winter of 1860-61 and the summer of the latter year. The winter of
1861-2 was spent at Peel’s River and LaPierre’s house in the Rocky Mountains,
and in traveling from this point to Fort Simpson and back to Fort Good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Hope, on the Mackenzie. He left the last mentioned place on the first of June,
1862, and reached home in October. This enterprise terminated favorably, the
explorer having returned richly laden with specimens, after making a series of
observations on the physical geography, ethnology, and the habits of animals
of the regions visited, furnishing materials of great interest to science.”</p>

<p>Aside from the extensive collections in every department of natural history,
the geographical information acquired by Mr. Kennicott was of the greatest
importance.</p>

<p>In 1865, the Western Union Telegraph Company having determined to
extend their wires so as to connect the old world and the new by an overland
line passing through Russian America across Behring’s Sea to Russia in Asia, and
thence to the central cities of Europe, Mr. Kennicott’s knowledge of the territory
through which the proposed line was to pass made his services indispensable
to the Company. He was sought out, and his cooperation at once secured. He
entered upon this new labor, hoping not only to do whatever lay in his power
to make this enterprise a success, but hoping also still further to serve the great
cause that was so dear to him; and while thus engaged in the enthusiastic performance
of this self-imposed duty, in the prime of life, he has passed away.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander presented a curiously fruited specimen of <i>Quercus

constriction near the apex. It was collected by Mr. Wertheman,
near Coarse Gold Gulch, Fresno County.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns exhibited a specimen of an <i>Astrophyton</i>, caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
in the Ochotsk Sea, off Cape Lepatka, Kamschatka, by the crew
of the fishing brig Angenette.</p>

<p>Dr. H. Gibbons called the attention of the Academy to the near
approach of the season during which we might look for the recurrence
of the “meteoric shower,” which he witnessed in the year
1833.</p>

<p>Some remarks were made by Messrs. Gibbons, Keyes, Kellogg
and others in reference to the phenomena of meteors, and considerable
discussion followed as to the various ideas and theories
advanced in regard to them by different authors.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns exhibited several specimens of <i>Acmæa asmi</i>, Midd.,
collected by him at Baulines Bay; remarking that upon a recent
trip to the locality named, he found this species exceedingly numerous,
attached to <i>Chlorostoma funebrale</i>, A. Ad.; that he had not
seen in a single instance this Acmæa upon the rocks. Mr. Stearns
further submitted for the inspection of the Academy, a specimen
of <i>Haliotis Cracherodii</i>, which he had collected alive last month,
on the rocks near the outlet of Lobitas Creek into the ocean.
The Haliotis had been attacked by a pholad, probably <i>Navea
Newcombii</i>, and had defended itself by adding coating upon coating
of nacre, as the Navea progressed, until a large knob or protuberance
had been created in the interior of the shell. From a
partial examination of the borer, a specimen of which he had
dug out from another portion of the same Haliotis, he believed it
to belong to the species recently described by Mr. Tryon, viz:
<i>Navea Newcombii</i>.</p>

<h3>On the Subdivisions of the Cretaceous Formation in California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. M. GABB.</p>

<p>The recent appearance of a check list published by the Smithsonian Institute,
and entitled “Check List of the Invertebrate Fossils of North America—Eocene
and Oligocene—by T. A. Conrad,” renders it necessary that I should state
more clearly than has been done heretofore, the relations between the two members
of the Californian Cretaceous rocks; and should give all of the proofs that
have yet presented themselves, in support of my views.</p>

<p>In 1856, Mr. Conrad published a paper in Vol. 5, Pacific Railroad Reports,
pages 320, <i>et seq.</i>, in which he described fifteen shells from the “Eocene” rocks
of the Cañada de las Uvas, near the present site of Fort Tejon. Of these,
eleven were considered by that author as being new to science. The other
four were referred to previously described Eocene forms.</p>

<p>These specimens were procured by Mr. Wm. P. Blake, geologist of the
expedition. They were obtained from a single boulder, the only one found by
that gentleman.</p>

<p>In consideration of the scanty material, it is by no means surprising that Mr.
Conrad should have made the determination that he did. The fossils of this
locality, and, in fact, of this member of our Californian rocks, have a marked
Tertiary aspect. This holds good, both as applied to the appearance of the specimens
and also to the grouping of the genera. Mr. Conrad’s reference of these
fossils to an Eocene age was perfectly justified by the light that he then possessed.
Any other palæontologist, with the same specimens, would no doubt have done
as he did. But I propose to prove that, after having studied this formation for
five years, both in the field and in the closet—both palæontologically and stratigraphically—after
having traced it upwards of four hundred miles, and after
having collected fossils from it at a dozen localities, I, on the other hand, am
perfectly justified in pronouncing it most unequivocally Cretaceous.</p>

<p>It is, to use a mild term, rather surprising that Mr. Blake, from whom Mr.
Conrad obtained his material, should not have collected more specimens. According
to his report, Mr. Blake reached the depôt camp at Tejon, on the third
of September, 1853, and did not leave that vicinity until October 10th. During
that time he traversed the distance between Tejon and the Cañada de las
Uvas, four times. I am familiar with every foot of the ground on which he
camped or on which he travelled; and I speak from personal observation, when
I say that in going from one point to the other he could not avoid passing
thousands of boulders and pebbles, full of fossils, similar to the single one sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Mr. Conrad. In riding from the Ranch house of Tejon to Fort Tejon, on Mr.
Blake’s trail, Professor Brewer and myself collected upward of <i>forty</i> species of
mollusca in less than one hour, and without diverging ten feet from our route!</p>

<p>The Californian Cretaceous formation is easily separable into two main divisions.
The older of these, designated in the Report as “Division A,” is the
equivalent of the upper portions, Nos. 4 and 5, of Meek and Hayden’s section
in Nebraska, and the later beds of New Jersey and the Gulf States. It is possible
that this group may be separated hereafter into two sub-groups; but that
has no bearing on the question at issue. The upper or more modern member,
found overlying the lower one conformably in various places, as about Monte
Diablo and at Martinez, has no apparent equivalent in America. It is probably,
however, the American representative of the Maestricht beds, the ‘Danien’ of
French authors. It is <i>not</i> a transition from Cretaceous to Tertiary, but is the
most modern member of the former formation.</p>

<p>It has many points in common with the Maestricht beds of Europe. It contains
but a single species, so far as known, of the complex-chambered group of
Cephalopods. A solitary ammonite, represented by half a dozen specimens,
has been found by myself, in place, even to the very top of the formation.</p>

<p>Of 280 species of fossils recognized and named in the Californian Cretaceous
rocks, 107 are found in this upper member. Of these, 84 are peculiar, and 23
are found in common between undoubted members of this group and undoubted
members of the older group. Besides this, I was fortunate enough to discover
a locality near Clear Lake, this fall, where, within a space of two feet, I found
an admixture of upper and lower forms, proving the existence of a transitionary
bed or perhaps group of beds. The following table will exhibit at a glance the
grouping of species at each of the principal localities; showing at the same
time which species are found in the intermediate deposit, and which exist in
common in both the upper and lower divisions. The various localities are designated
by letters, as follows: M, Martinez; C, Clayton to Marsh’s; T, vicinity
of Fort Tejon; G, a locality 10 miles west of Griswold’s near New Idria;
I, New Idria; D, San Diego; LL, Lower Lake Village, 1 mile S.E. of the town.</p>

<p>On studying the foregoing table, the following deductions present themselves:
1st, that the rocks of the upper division, at the various localities quoted, are
all of the same geological age; and 2d, that they are intimately connected
with the older groups by a passage of nearly a fifth of all the contained species
of fossils from this, either into the intermediate beds, or into the lower group
itself.</p>

<p>In anticipation of a possible objection that may be raised here, it will probably
be as well, before going further, to state that in the Division B, there has
been no confounding of two groups. The same grouping of species extends to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the extreme upper limits of the fossiliferous rocks, which are everywhere overlain
by an immense deposit of non-fossiliferous sandstones. Another objection,
which has already been raised, that the acknowledged Cretaceous fossils have
become mixed with more modern species by the breaking up and re-cementing
of an older formation, I shall not even attempt to refute. Had such been the
case, I would ere this, in common honesty, have acknowledged it.</p>

<p>In support of the two conclusions arrived at above, we have the following
synopsis of the table:</p>

<p>Of the 107 species of fossils found in Division B, 44 are found at Clayton,
67 at Tejon, 54 at Martinez, 22 at San Diego, 18 near Griswold’s, and 7 near
New Idria. It is not intended to be understood that these are all of the species
found at these localities; but that, up to the present time, these are all that
have been identified or described. Future work will undoubtedly change the
above figures.</p>

<p>Of the species found at the above localities, 50 are peculiar to one or another
locality; 29 are found at two localities only, 14 at three localities, and 14 at
four localities or more.</p>

<p>Taking the three typical localities, Martinez, Clayton and Tejon, 21 species
are common to Martinez and Clayton, 30 to Martinez and Tejon, 25 to Clayton
and Tejon, and 20 are found at all three localities.</p>

<p>Now, having given what I believe ought to be considered proof conclusive
to any candid mind in support of my first proposition, I shall endeavor to
establish the second.</p>

<p>It will be seen that 16 species, found in the upper member, also extend into
the older group, Division A. In addition to this, at the locality near Lower Lake
Village, Lake County, besides several species encountered for the first time, I found
15 species in the same bed, within a superficial area of two feet. Of these, 3 were
previously known to be common to the upper and lower division. Besides these
3, 7 of them were common to this locality, and localities of Division B, and the
remaining 5 were, before this discovery, considered peculiar to the lower member.
One of these 5 is found in the Mississippi Valley, in the “Ripley Group,”
and another belongs to a peculiarly Cretaceous genus.</p>

<p>As to the species found at the several typical localities, independent of each
other, and which would serve to show their individual relations to the older formation
without corroborative evidence, Clayton has 10 species in common with
Division A, Tejon has 7, and Martinez 11. With the Lower Lake bed, Clayton
has 5 species in common, Tejon 5, and Martinez 6.</p>

<p>In glancing over Mr. Conrad’s “check list,” I find that out of the 107 species
found in his “Older Eocene of California,” he has only included 74 in his
enumeration. He has omitted Callianassa Stimpsonii, Ammonites n. s., Nautilus
Texanus, Cylichna costata, Mactra Ashburnerii, Cucullæa Mathewsonii,
Nucula truncata, and Leda protexta; eight species, which I mentioned in the
Journal of Conchology, (Vol. 2, p. 88) as being found in common in the two
members of the Cal. cretaceous, stating distinctly the localities in which they
had been found. At the same time he includes five other species, from the same
list, in his Eocene catalogue. Whether this be carelessness, or an unfair avoidance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of a difficulty, I leave to others to decide. It is far easier to ignore such
a difficulty than it is to explain it away.</p>

<p>In regard to the distribution of the genera and species in this and the associated
rocks. All of the species are peculiar to this group, or to this and <i>underlying</i>
rocks; <i>not one</i> has been found associated either with living forms, or with species
known to occur in the recognized Tertiaries of California. Five of the
genera are peculiar to the Secondary. An Ammonite ranges entirely through
the group to the top of the highest fossiliferous strata. The genera Perissolax,
Gyrodes, Margaritella, and the sub-genus Anchura, of the genus Aporrhais, are
all recognized as strictly characteristic of the Cretaceous; so much so, that the
presence of a single undoubted representative of either of these genera would
be strong presumptive evidence of the Cretaceous age of any rocks in which it
might be found. On the other hand, the presence of such genera as those in
the list given below, would point to a very modern era in the Cretaceous, to
say the least.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that we have much to learn yet in palæontology,
especially in the matter of the vertical range of genera. Every year we find
genera, nay, whole families, extending themselves beyond what had been fixed
by previous authors as their limits. A few years ago, the presence of mammalian
remains was considered characteristic of the Tertiaries. Now we know
of Marsupials in the Trias, and who dare say that we cannot find mammals in
palæozoic rocks? I therefore maintain, that though we have here such genera
as Aturia, Typhis, Cordiera, Pseudoliva, Nassa, Mitra, Ficus, Morio, Cerithiopsis,
Cypræa and Galerus, still, the only inference that can be drawn is, that the
group is on or near the verge of the formation, a sort of prophetic member,
presaging by some of its genera the formations to come, but indissolubly
bound by specific ties with the eras preceding.</p>

<h3>Fossil Fish in the Great Basin, Nevada.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>Fossilized fish are found in a light-colored clay shale, in the mountains a few
miles north of Silver Peak, a mining district in the Red Mountain or Salt
Basin region, about one hundred and fifty miles south of Austin. The vertebral
columns, ribs and fins are very distinctly shown, and the specimens are
exceedingly interesting. They remind me of the specimens from the famous
locality of Mount Bolca, in Europe. The specimen that I have here, does not
appear to belong to an ancient period, but I will not venture to refer it without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
an opportunity of making comparisons, or submitting it to a competent ichthyologist,
which I propose to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">College of California</span>, Nov. 19. 1866.</p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Blake also directed the attention of the Academy to specimens
of fossil vertebræ, collected by him in Tulare County. These
specimens are about twenty in number, and are from two to six
inches in length, and two to three inches in diameter. He believed
them to belong to large marine saurians, like crocodiles, but wished
to make further study and comparison previous to making a more
formal communication to the Academy. If correct in his opinion,
it was, he believed, the first instance of the discovery of saurian
remains on the Pacific Coast of the United States, and the discovery
will be rendered still more interesting by the fact that the
remains occur in strata reputed to be miocene, associated with
sharks’ teeth and numerous marine remains, at least fifteen hundred
feet above the present ocean level.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney remarked that the remains of the crocodile,
and ichthyosaurus had been discovered on this coast by the Geological
Survey, and the fact published a year ago.</p>

<h3>Notice of the occurrence of the Silurian Series in Nevada.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. D. WHITNEY.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Academy in May last, I gave some account of the geology
of the State of Nevada, with particular reference to the age of the stratified
deposits occurring there, as determined from the collections of fossils
brought from that region to the office of the Geological Survey, by J. E. Clayton,
and various members of our corps. In that communication I spoke of
the probable future discovery of rocks older than the Carboniferous or Devonian,
in the mountain ranges near Austin. This expectation has been realized, and
we are now in possession of a very interesting collection of fossils, obtained by
Mr. A. Blatchley, in the vicinity of the Hot Creek Mining District about one
hundred miles southeast of Austin. This collection enables us to state positively
that both Upper and Lower Silurian rocks occur in that district, and
that they are well filled with fossils; not less so indeed, to judge from the specimens
received, than the strata of the same age in New York, Ohio, Iowa, and
Wisconsin, which they resemble in a most marked degree, both lithologically
and palæontologically.</p>

<p>The fossils from the Hot Creek District are mostly weathered out on the surfaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of thin slabs of bluish-gray argillaceous limestones, and are crowded together
in the same profusion with which they have often been noticed by myself
and others as occurring in the Lower Silurian shales and limestones of the Wisconsin
Lead Region, around Big Bay des Noquets, and in many other localities
in the country bordering on the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>Both the upper and lower divisions of the Silurian appear to be represented
by the fossils of the Hot Creek District; but the lower Silurian seems to be
much the most prolific in fossils, as is the case in Wisconsin and Iowa. The
particular period to which these lower Silurian forms may be referred is the
Trenton, including the Chazy, Birdseye, Black River and Trenton limestones of
the New York Geologists, and the Buff and Blue limestones of the Western
surveys. Nearly all the prevailing types of the Eastern rocks of this age, are
represented in the Hot Creek collection, namely: Brachiopods, Gasteropods,
Cephalopods, Crinoids, Trilobites, and Corals; and there are among them several
of the most widely-distributed and most characteristic species of the
Lower Silurian. The following have been identified: <i>Maclurea magna</i>, a
characteristic Chazy species, and <i>Pleurotoma lenticularis</i>, <i>Orthis testudinaria</i> and
<i>Chætetes lycoperdon</i>, all of which are abundant in the Trenton limestone of New
York, and the rocks of the same age farther West. Among the fragments of
Trilobites, two or three different genera may be recognized, especially <i>Asaphus</i>,
which is represented by a species apparently new. There are also fragments
of crinoids or cystids closely resembling the species figured by Hall, in
the Palæontology of New York, Vol. I, as <i>Echino-encrinites anatiformis</i>.</p>

<p>The rocks containing the above mentioned fossils crop out in the sides of a
deep cañon; and overlying them, at a perpendicular distance of about a thousand
feet, is a series of beds containing numerous fragments of corals and crinoids,
silicified and weathered out from the surface of a bluish-gray limestone, which
I refer without much doubt to the age of the Niagara limestone of New York.
Among the corals, <i>Heliolites spinipora</i> and <i>Syringopora</i> are recognizable; and
among the crinoidal fragments are stems of what appears to be <i>Caryocrinus
ornatus</i>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Potsdam sandstone fossils, described by Meek and
Hayden as occurring at the base of the fossiliferous series, in the Black Hills,
no recognizable Silurian forms have been observed by geologists, in the Rocky
Mountains, or anywhere to the west of them, unless possibly in New Mexico.
The Silurian Series, with the possible exception of the Potsdam sandstone,
seems to be entirely wanting in the Rocky Mountains proper, the Black Hills
being a sort of outlier of the main ranges, and lying as far east as the one hundred
and third to the one hundred and fifth meridian. Dr. Hayden says, in his
paper, on the Geology and Natural History of the Upper Missouri, published in
1862, that “hitherto no indications of the existence of any other member (than
the Potsdam sandstone) of the Silurian period has been discovered along the
eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains within the boundary of the United States.”
He considers it probable that the Potsdam sandstone is represented in the
Rocky Mountains, although no fossils of that member of the series has been
as yet discovered anywhere to the west of the Black Hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Mexican Boundary Survey, a few fragments of fossils were found in
the superficial detritus, near El Paso, (Longitude, one hundred and six degrees)
which indicated the existence of Silurian rocks in that vicinity; but none appear
to have been found in place. Professor Hall remarks that “the specimens referable
to strata of this age (Devonian and Silurian) are few, and they are in
such condition as to give little satisfactory information regarding the rocks in
place.” The specimens obtained are figured in the Mexican Boundary Report,
but not described, nor is their locality accurately stated.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry, in his Report in the Geology of the Colorado River region,
refers the lower portion of the strata exposed in the grand cañons of that river
to the Devonian and Silurian Series; but as no recognizable fossils were discovered
by the Ives’ Expedition from any rocks lower than the Carboniferous,
this reference can only be taken as expressing a conviction based on lithological
characters and stratigraphical considerations.</p>

<p>In view of the above cited facts, it will be seen at once how interesting this
discovery is of undoubted Silurian rocks west of the Rocky Mountains; and
the more so, since we have in this remote region a recurrence of conditions and
forms of animal life so closely allied to those with which we are familiar in
the States east of the Mississippi. It is a very remarkable fact that these
rocks have not been discovered in the Rocky Mountains; and should farther
explorations fail to reveal their presence, it will throw a new light on the history
of the physical development of the central and western portions of this continent.
Taking into view what has now been communicated, and what was stated
in my previous paper in regard to the existence of the older stratified rocks in
the Silver Peak District, it will appear that Dr. Newberry’s generalizations
were, in all probability, correct, and that we may expect to find in southern
and southwestern Nevada the outcropping fossiliferous edges of the strata
underlying the Carboniferous of the great Arizona or Colorado plateau, and
that they will be proved to occupy an extensive area, and to yield a profusion of
organic remains.</p>

<p>Among the specimens collected by Mr. Blatchley, as also by Mr. Clayton,
Mr. Melville Attwood, and Dr. C. L. Anderson, and now at our office, there is a
considerable number which demonstrate the existence of an extensive fresh-water
Tertiary deposit in Nevada. This formation, which belongs to a very
late Tertiary epoch, evidently occupies a considerable area, as our specimens
come from localities hundreds of miles distant from each other. The existence
of any marine formation more recent than the Jurassic, in Nevada, has not yet
been proved; but, as Mr. Gabb obtained evidence, in 1864, of the occurrence
of rocks of Cretaceous age on Crooked River, in Oregon, east of the Cascade
Range, it is possible that this member of the series may yet be discovered in
Nevada.</p>

<p>All the fossils referred to in this and my previous communication on the
geology of Nevada, will receive, in due time, thorough investigation at the
hands of Messrs. Meek and Gabb, or other competent palæontologists; and we
expect that our collections from that State will be largely increased during the
present year.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney read some extracts from letters just received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
from Mr. Rémond, giving an account of his geological explorations
in Peru and Chile. Mr. Rémond has obtained a suite of plants
from the coal-bearing formation of Northern Chile, sufficient in
number to fix its age as Triassic. Two species, one a <i>Pecopteris</i>,
the other a <i>Pterophyllum</i>, are apparently identical with those found
with the coal near Los Bronces, in Sonora, Mexico, by Mr. Rémond.
Above the coal-bearing conglomerates and sandstones, there are
stratified porphyries, and above these, fossiliferous limestones of
Liassic age. The fossils in this last mentioned formation are, in
general, similar to those found by Domeyko and Darwin, at Las Juntas
and Tres Cruces; but Mr. Rémond obtained several new species.
He also collected a large number of species in the Tertiaries of
Coquimbo and Caldera. Farther, he obtained fossils in sufficient
numbers from the rocks in which are the famous silver mines of
Chañarcillo and Tres Puntas, to fix their age as belonging to the
Lower Cretaceous.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney commented on the importance of these
investigations, especially that concerning the age of the Chile coal.
It is very interesting to know that the same formation carries coal
in Chile which has been found to bear that indispensable material
in Northern Mexico. The vast extent over which Triassic rocks
occur in Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, gives a peculiar
interest to every discovery of this kind.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>On the Nourishment of the Fœtus in the Embiotocoid Fishes.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.</p>

<p>I am not aware that the process by which the embryo of the Embiotocoid
fishes receive the nourishment necessary for its growth, has ever been pointed out.
It certainly differs from the three most common forms in which the embryo of
other animals is nourished, as there is nothing like a placenta by which they
can receive nourishment from the mother; there is no supply of nutriment
surrounding the embryo, as in the case of most oviparous animals, nor is the
embryo brought into direct contact with the water, so as to derive nourishment
by absorption from the surrounding medium, as is the case in oviparous fishes
generally and in most of the lower forms of animal life. The young fish is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
contained in a uterus which, in the undeveloped state, resembles very much the
ovaries of the common oviparous fishes, except that its walls are thicker, and
that the number of ova it contains is very much smaller. In the interior of
the uterus, projecting from its sides, are a number of processes analogous to
those to which the ova are usually attached. These processes vary in number
in different examples, but they are so arranged that each fœtal fish is in contact
on every side with a surface of one of these processes. They consist apparently
of a membrane composed of a cellular tissue, and scattered over their surface
are a number of small mammillary elevations with an orifice in the center, and
which are probably the organs by which the peculiar secretion of the uterus, to
be hereafter noticed, is poured out. In an example I examined, in which impregnation
had apparently just taken place, numerous ova were found adhering
to these processes, although not at all in such numbers as in the ordinary fishes.
I counted thirty-eight in about the space of an inch; of these, however, but
few can be developed, as the number of fœtuses seldom exceeds forty, and
sometimes is only eight. In the whole of the uterus there probably were from
one hundred to one hundred and fifty ova. Of the earlier stages of development,
however, it is not my object to treat in the present memoir, as I did not
commence my investigations sufficiently early to be able fully to make it out.
As soon, however, as the embryo has advanced sufficiently for the fins to be
formed, these appendages are found to be terminated by a number of digitations,
which project from the free edges of the fin, and are usually found situated, one
between each ray or spine. They are composed almost entirely of fine capillary
blood-vessels, united apparently by a very delicate and structureless membrane.
They are so delicate that unless great care is taken in removing the specimen
from the uterus, they are destroyed; nor have I ever been able to discover them
in specimens that have been preserved in alcohol. These processes seem continuous
with the membrane extended between the rays of the fins, but are much
more delicate; they project from the free edge of the fin, sometimes as much
as the eighth of an inch, and are, in the fully developed embryo, the fifteenth
of an inch broad. On the free margin of each digitation, a larger capillary
can be observed, which appears to be continuous all around; it is about
the .003 in. in diameter, the intermediate space being filled with a net-work of
smaller capillaries. This system of digitations projects from the entire edge
of the dorsal, ventral and caudal fins, but not from the pectorals. They in fact
form a fringe round the entire body, with the exception of the head and that
part of the abdomen in front of the anus.</p>

<p>Such is the structure of the organ that evidently has some connection with
the nourishment of the fœtus, resembling as it does so closely the early formation
of the vascular villi and the placental tufts that proceed from the chorion
of the mammiferous embryo, and through which it derives its nourishment
before the placenta is fully formed.</p>

<p>The question now presents itself as to how nourishment is conveyed from the
parent to the fœtus through these tufts? As before stated, the lining membrane
of the uterus sends off processes which surround each fœtus, without
however forming sheet sacks; but although these processes are very freely supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
with blood-vessels, yet the finest injection failed to show any more vascular
spots where the fœtal digitations might have been brought into more immediate
contact with the blood of the parent. I however was fortunate enough to
obtain a fish, in the uterus of which I discovered a considerable quantity of
fluid, and on collecting it, and submitting it to chemical tests, I found that this
fluid contained a considerable quantity of an animal substance, resembling, to a
certain extent, some of the compounds that are formed from albumen during
the process of digestion. The fluid was of yellowish color, translucent, deposited
on standing some small globules which under the microscope strongly
refracted the light, were not altered by acetic acid, but dissolved in ether;
probably fat globules; when heated, there was no coagulation, although the
fluid was not quite so clear; solution of Hg Cl₂ caused no precipitate; tannin
in solution caused a yellowish precipitate. In adding ether to a portion of the
fluid, there was a free disengagement of gas, a white flocculent precipitate was
formed, and on allowing the vessel to stand, the fluid separated itself into three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
portions: the upper portion consisting of pure ether apparently, then a layer
containing white flocculi, which occupied about the fourth part of the fluid, and
below this the remains of the original fluid, but little altered in appearance.
There can, I think, be little doubt but that it is through the medium of this
fluid that the fœtus obtains its nourishment. The considerable portion of animal
matter it contains, and that too in a state particularly fitted for absorption
and for conversion into tissue, fits it for furnishing the fœtus with the elements
necessary for its growth by absorption through the large surface of capillary
vessels which are found in the vascular digitations that surround the fœtus, and
which are constantly bathed in the fluid. The difficulty that up to the present
time has attended every attempt to trace the connection between the parent
and fœtus in these embiotocoid fishes, is owing, in the first place, to the extreme
delicacy of the vascular digitations of the fœtus, which prevents their
being observed in preserved specimens, and also to the fact that in almost
every case the fluid secreted by the uterus is entirely expelled by the violent
struggles of the fish when removed from the water, so that it was almost by
a rare accident that I succeeded in obtaining any. I hope, however, during the
coming season, to be able more fully to carry out these researches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, January 21st, 1867.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Bolander exhibited the cones of many species of pines growing
in this State, and stated what was known concerning the
peculiarities of the different species, and their geographical distribution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He stated that the pines of California comprise sixteen true species, which
he described briefly. There are twenty synonyms for these species, which have
created some confusion as to their real name and number. The correct names
of all, with the popular characteristics of the most striking, and their distribution,
are given herewith. The names marked thus * are those of trees having
persistent cones, which they retain from ten to twenty years in some instances.
Those marked thus † retain their cones but two years. Those marked thus ‡ retain
them but one year:</p>

<p><i>Pinus insignis.</i>*—Well known as the ornamental Monterey pine, which is
much cultivated in San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>P. muricata.</i>*—Not remarkable.</p>

<p><i>P. contorta.</i>*—Small and bushy, but valuable as shelter against wind. Grows
abundantly near Fort Bragg, in the Mendocino country, where it makes the
stoutest wind-proof hedge known. Ought to be tried in San Francisco.</p>

<p><i>P. tuberculata.</i>*—Always small, seldom higher than 15 to 30 feet.</p>

<p><i>P. ponderosa.</i>‡—The well known yellow pine. Attains a height of 225 feet
and more, and a circumference of 23 or 24 feet.</p>

<p><i>P. Lambertiana.</i>*—The equally well known, larger and handsome “sugar
pine,” or “long-cone pine” of Frémont. Usually grows at great altitudes;
exceedingly valuable for timber, and affords the principal supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p><i>P. Coulteri.</i>†—Found in the lower eastern slope of the Coast Range. Not
very large; sometimes attains a height of 75 feet; knotty, but ornamental. It
is remarkable for having the largest cone of all the pines, and specimens of its
cone, when first known, brought five guineas in England.</p>

<p><i>P. Sabiniana.</i>†—This is the nut pine of the foothills, sometimes called the
“scrub pine,” or “silver pine.” The Digger Indians gather the nuts from its
cone as a favorite article of food. It is found on the foothills of both Coast
Ranges and Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander mentioned several species in the group of coast pines which
he had not seen, viz: <i>P. Llaveana</i>, east of San Diego; <i>P. deflexa</i>, on the summit
of the California Mountains; <i>P. Torreyana</i>,* near San Diego.</p>

<p><i>P. monticola.</i>‡—A tall tree and affording fine timber; said to be hardier than
the sugar pine, and might be preferred if its position near the summit did not
make it difficult of access.</p>

<p><i>P. flexilis.</i>‡—This grows on windy heights in the form of a low shrub, so
stout and thick that a man can stand on its top. In low altitudes it reaches a
height of a hundred feet. It is useful only for firewood.</p>

<p><i>P. monophylla.</i>—This is a stunted, twisted tree, which grows on the eastern
slope of the Sierra, where it corresponds to the nut-pine on the western slope.
At a distance it resembles in shape the live oak. Its cone is ill shapen and
has an offensive odor, but yields a sweet nut.</p>

<p><i>P. Balfouriana.</i>—This species is found near Scott’s Valley, in Northern
California.</p>

<h3>On the Fresh Water Infusorial Deposits of the Pacific Coast,
and their Connection with the Volcanic Rocks.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. D. WHITNEY.</p>

<p>The microscopic discoveries of the last few years have immensely extended
the range and importance of the minute, and, to the naked eye, invisible organisms,
which, under the general designation of “Infusoria,” are recognized as a
part of the kingdom of nature. It is especially to Ehrenberg that we are indebted
for a demonstration of the geological importance of the Diatoms, those
microscopic organisms which so long puzzled naturalists to decide whether they
were animal or vegetable in their nature, but which are now, by the majority
of zoölogists, referred to as plants. In Ehrenberg’s great work, the “Mikrogeologie,”
or geology in little, this eminent naturalist has given the results of the
examination, by himself, of specimens of infusorial rocks, soils, ashes, dust, and
other accumulations or masses of matter from every quarter of the globe:
these investigations show most conclusively that deposits of vast extent—of
such magnitude, indeed, as to form no inconsiderable portion of the earth’s
crust—are the result of organic agencies, and that what seems to the eye an
unorganized mass, may in reality be made up of the delicately wrought and
almost infinitely minute remains of plant or animal life.</p>

<p>That animals, or plants, so minute that a hundred millions of distinct individuals
will scarcely weigh a single grain, should form accumulations hundreds
of feet in thickness and extending over thousands of square miles, seems a
hardly credible statement; but a fact still more difficult to believe and comprehend
is one which is thoroughly established by abundant evidence, namely:
that immense deposits of volcanic materials, or, at least, of materials closely
connected in their origin and nature with volcanic action, and spread over vast
tracts of country in different parts of the world, are also, to a large extent,
made up of these microscopic organisms, the existence of which seems dependent
on the presence of water, and so utterly at variance with a condition
of volcanic activity.</p>

<p>Throughout this volcanic region of California, Oregon, Nevada, and probably
as far north as the igneous masses extend, which are well known to cover a
vast area on the western side of our continent, there are found deposits, which
are usually called “fire-clay,” “kaolin,” “pipe-clay,” or simply “clay;”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> these
masses are, however, not at all of the nature of kaolin, nor are they proper
clay, although they may, in places, pass into clay or shale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The material of which this deposit is made up is exceedingly fine-grained,
seemingly an impalpable powder, usually perfectly white and more or less distinctly
stratified. It is extremely light, and resembles commercial magnesia
more than anything else. In its geological position, it is found underlying the
basaltic masses, or the products of the last great eruptive action of the Sierra
Nevada. It is often associated with, or intercalated among beds of gravel,
fine or coarse-grained sandstone and shales, and bears the evident marks of being
a sedimentary deposit made along the sides of a gently-descending broad valley,
or lake-like expansion of a valley. This is its character in the Sierra Nevada;
but as we go north and northeast, and come on to the great volcanic table lands
of Northern California and Southern and Eastern Oregon, we find the thickness
of the deposits of this kind of material increasing, and the area occupied
by them more considerable. The following localities are especially worthy of
notice: North of Virginia City, Nevada; Surprise Valley; Pit River, near
mouth of Canoe Creek; Klamath Basin, or in the vicinity of Wright, Rhett
and Klamath Lakes; the Des Chutes Basin.</p>

<p>Of all the localities, the last mentioned would seem to be the most
remarkable for the extent and thickness of the deposits in question. It
was from here that the first specimens examined by Ehrenberg, in 1849,
were brought by Frémont, who represented the deposit as 500 feet thick.
This region has since been examined by Dr. Newberry, who describes the
cañons of the tributaries of the Des Chutes as in places 2,000 feet deep,
the plateaux between which cañons are covered by basaltic lava, and
this is seen, in the magnificent sections thus presented, to rest on a thickness of
hundreds of feet of tufaceous strata interstratified with a variety of beds of
volcanic conglomerates, pumice sand, ashes, etc. Dr. Newberry speaks of tufaceous
strata 1,200 feet in thickness, in the cañon near the mouth of the Mptolyas
River.</p>

<p>The white material, of which some of the more prominent localities have
been indicated above, and which is well known to explorers under so many
names, as already mentioned, is in reality chiefly of a silicious character, and
made up, to a large extent, of organic bodies of microscopic dimensions, infusoria,
or <i>Diatomaceæ</i>. This fact was first recognized in the case of the specimens
collected by Frémont on the Des Chutes River, and examined by Bailey and
Ehrenberg. Specimens collected by Dr. Newberry, on the Pacific Railroad
Survey, were also examined by Professor Bailey, but I am not aware that any
detailed description of the results was ever published.</p>

<p>Among the collection of the Geological Survey are a large number of specimens
of the white infusorial deposit, underlying the lava at various localities.
Of these a preliminary examination has been made by Professor Brewer, and a
large supply of material is now in the hands of Mr. A. M. Edwards, of New
York, for a detailed examination and report. The fact has been already well
demonstrated that all or nearly all these fine, white, light masses are made up,
to a large extent, of the silicious remains of the <i>diatomaceæ</i>, and in all cases
of forms peculiar to fresh water. The geological position of these beds is extremely
recent. They extend from the latter portion of the Pliocene into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Post-pliocene epoch, and seem to have continued their existence nearly, if not
quite, down to the present day.</p>

<p>So far the facts are very simple, and the principal results of our detailed
microscopic examination of these infusorial deposits will be, the knowledge of
the range of the different species which occur in them, and the relations of the
various forms to those now living, either in this region or in other parts of the
world. This the extent of our collections will give us better opportunities to
do than others have yet had.</p>

<p>There is a point, however, of great interest connected with these deposits, in
regard to which I desire to make some remarks at this present time, and on
which I consider that our explorations are capable of throwing some light.</p>

<p>Ehrenberg has recently<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> examined a specimen collected many years ago, in
the Toluca Valley, Mexico, by the well-known mining engineer Burkart, of
what he denominates a “Phytolitharien Tuff” or phytolithic tufa, and which
came to him labeled “Trachytic Tufa, from Toluca Valley, <i>quere</i>, whether
pumice-like or infusorial.” Of this, Ehrenberg says: “It is a silver-gray, easily
crumbled, gritty tufa, which does not effervesce with acids, and which, when
heated, becomes darker, but not black, and then assumes a light-brownish color.”
The microscopic analysis of it showed that it was made up to a large extent of
phytolitharia, which probably belong chiefly to the grasses, and between them
lie scattered a comparatively small number of bacillaria. All are fresh-water
forms.</p>

<p>In his remarks on this material, Ehrenberg recalls the other specimens of infusorial
tufas, which have been examined by him, at various times, since 1839.
He mentions particularly the rock from the Des Chutes River, collected by Frémont;
also trachytic tufa, with organic remains, from Honduras; trachytic
tufa from the volcano Maibu, in Chile; the mud-ejections (?) of the volcanoes
near Quito; the ejections (?) of the volcano Imbabaru, as well as those from
the island of Guadaloupe.</p>

<p>In regard to the Des Chutes River deposit, it may be incidentally remarked
that the eminent microscopist seems to assign to it a much greater geological
age than it really deserves; it is, unquestionably, as recent as the latter part of
the Pliocene.</p>

<p>It would appear from what Ehrenberg has published, that he considers this
occurrence of organic forms, in connection with reputed volcanic masses, to be
something extremely difficult to explain, as indeed it is, if we adopt the view
taken by him, namely, that these so-called tufaceous materials are the direct
products of volcanic action; that is to say, that they have been ejected from
craters, either in the form of showers of ashes or of mud out-flows. It would be,
indeed, to my comprehension, something entirely inexplicable, that such vast
masses of matter, made up to a large extent of organic forms, should be poured
forth from the interior of the earth. This would be the case, as it appears to
me, no matter what theory of volcanic action one might choose to adopt;
since, whatever may be the cause, no one will deny that a high temperature is,
at least, one of the results. That Ehrenberg really considers these infusorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
deposits to be of eruptive origin, is evident from a remark in his last communication,
(that in reference to the specimen from the Toluca Valley) to the
effect that the occurrence of fresh-water forms, exclusively, in these infusorial
masses is evidence that volcanic phenomena are not dependent on, or connected
with, the presence of sea-water, as is generally supposed, from the fact that volcanoes
are situated, in most cases, near the sea coast.</p>

<p>Not having the necessary works of reference at hand to be able to see, in all
the cases cited by Ehrenberg, exactly what the evidence is, on which his theory
of the origin of these infusorial deposits is founded, I will not attempt to give
an authoritative statement in regard to any others than those which belong to
this coast; but I cannot avoid drawing the inference, that the same conditions
which are so easily traced here will, on future examination, be found existing in
all the other localities cited by him.</p>

<p>The mode of occurrence of these fresh-water infusorial deposits in California,
and on the Pacific coast in general, is very simple. They are accumulations of
organisms which have been collected at the bottom of the lakes, or in the lake-like
shallow expansions of rivers, in which they grew. This growth took place
at a time when volcanic agencies were busily at work, giving rise to accumulations
of ashes, pumice, and other materials. The rapidity with which these infusorial
deposits form, at the present time even, the vast extent over which they
are distributed, and the general importance in the geological history of the
earth, are now matters which are well understood, of the masses thus accumulated
and in regard to which the store of facts has been rapidly growing in magnitude
during the past few years. The mud deposits and deltas of rivers, the bottoms
of lakes and swamps, and the bed of the ocean itself, are the repositories of
these forms. Heat and stagnant water seem to be what is required for their
rapid reproduction and the consequent rapid accumulation of their remains.</p>

<p>The infusorial deposits of Central California—I refer now to those of fresh
water origin, and connected with volcanic masses—are all situated in such
positions as to show, that they were formed and deposited in shallow water;
that, through the various alternations of calm and convulsion in the Sierra, they
were at one time allowed to accumulate in quiet, then swept over by masses of
gravel and sand, indicating a furious rush of water, then covered with a shower
of ashes and pumice from the neighboring volcanoes of the Sierra then in active
operation; and finally, at the grand finale of the basaltic lava overflow of the
chain, capped with this indestructible material, which has effectually prevented
the washing away of the otherwise easily removed infusorial deposits. This is
the connection between the volcanic and the infusorial masses; by their absolute
indestructibility the former have protected the latter from denudation, and
consequently we see them always accompanying each other: for where the cover
did not exist, there the denuding forces have swept away every vestige of the
soft and easily yielding material, or else it remains concealed under the water.
To form an idea of the extent of the erosion which has taken place since these
infusorial beds were deposited, and the consequent change in the configuration
of the country, we must bear in mind that the whole of the present river cañons
on the west slope of the Sierra have been excavated since that time, and that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
many places, the strata have been removed to a vertical depth of between two
and three thousand feet.</p>

<p>Everything shows that the surface covered by fresh water in the region east
of the crest of the Sierra was, at a not very distant epoch, much greater in extent
than it now is. There existed, probably during or immediately after the
glacial epoch, a chain of great lakes occupying a large portion of the country
from Walker’s Lake to the Des Chutes River, a distance of about four hundred
miles, and extending over a breadth of not less than one hundred. A large
portion of this region is now a volcanic plateau; and, where cut into by the force
of running water, the deposits of infusorial strata may be seen, sometimes thin
and unimportant, but often of great thickness. Observations and measurements
of terraces and determination of the altitude of all these old lake deposits will
enable us at some future time to indicate on the map the area once occupied by
this great chain of inland seas. The vast extent of the lacustrine infusorial
formations on the east side of the Sierra is thus accounted for, as well as the
comparatively small area which they cover on the western slope.</p>

<p>In addition to the stratigraphical reason given above why the infusorial
strata should occur connected with eruptive masses, there may be a chemical
one which shall, in part, account for the apparent great development of the
<i>diatomaceæ</i> in volcanic regions. These organisms require an amount of silica,
infinitesimally small for each individual, but in reality enormous for the number
of organisms required to develop themselves over the vast area and with the
thickness which they occupy. That a volcanic region should supply a larger
amount of silica in the state in which it can be appropriated by the <i>diatomaceæ</i>,
is extremely probable. We know that silicification of all organic matters
occurring in these volcanic regions of our coast proceeds with the greatest
rapidity, and has taken place on an extensive scale. The thermal springs contain
a great amount of free silica, and it is in the vicinity of such springs that
large infusorial deposits are frequently found. It seems that it could only be in
regions particularly favorable for the secretion of their silicious coverings, that
these infusoria could be accumulated with such rapidity as to form what may
be called, without exaggeration, mountain masses. It is also possible that temperature
may have something to do with this rapid development, and that volcanic
regions may on this account be favorable to it.</p>

<p>To my apprehension, the phenomena of infusorial deposits in connection with
volcanic masses admit of an easy explanation on this coast, at least; and I can
hardly believe that any of the localities of <i>diatomaceæ</i>, if closely examined,
would present any such difficulties as to make the assumption necessary that
they have been ejected from the interior of the earth. In cases where infusoria
seem to have been actually ejected from craters, as is said to have been the case
in some of the South American volcanoes, it is not difficult to understand that
an ancient crater may have become filled up and temporarily converted into a
lake; and that, after the growth and deposition of an infusorial deposit at the
bottom, a new eruption may have broken out in the same place as a previous
one, or in its immediate neighborhood. In such a case, among the ejected material,
a large quantity of the infusoria would be found mingled with the ashes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
which must pass through the material collected in the bottom of the crater as
they rise from the interior of the earth. The bursting of lakes at the bases of
volcanic cones, caused by the rapid melting of the snows above them, have
often given rise to torrents of volcanic mud, called “Moya” in South America,
in which both animal and vegetable remains are often inclosed in great quantity;
but the connection between the organic and inorganic phenomena, in such cases,
is perfectly evident.</p>

<p>In fact, I see no reason for suspecting any connection between the infusorial
deposits and the volcanic masses of this coast, or of any other part of the world,
which should influence the geologist in forming an opinion with regard to the
cause or the locality of volcanic action.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be remarked that the marine infusorial rocks of the
Pacific coast, and especially of California, are of great extent and importance.
They occur in the Coast Ranges, from Clear Lake to Los Angeles. They are
of no little economical, as well as scientific, interest; since, as I conceive, the
existence of bituminous materials in this State, in all their forms, from the most
liquid to the most dense, is due to the presence of infusoria—the proofs of which
statement I will, at some future time, endeavor to set before the Academy.</p>

<h3>Notice of Fossil Elephants’ Teeth from the Northwest Coast.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>The two molar teeth of the extinct elephant which I exhibit this evening
were presented to me by Col. Bulkley, Superintendent of the American and
Russian Telegraph. One is from the mouth of the Yukon River, and the other
from St. Paul’s Island, near the middle of Behring’s Sea. The remains of
elephants are abundant in both places. Tusks are sometimes found, and one
has been sent by Col. Bulkley to the Smithsonian Institution. These new
localities may be regarded as forming a connecting link between those of Siberia
and America, and indicate the former continuous distribution of the ancient
elephant upon the two continents.</p>

<p>The following list of localities, known to me, of similar fossils in California,
will show that the elephant must have been frequently seen here in very early
times: At Mare Island; in Placer County, near Forest Hill; in Tuolumne
County, at Columbia, Shaw’s Flat, Texas Flat and near Sonora; in Calaveras
County, at Knight’s Ferry; in Los Angeles County, at San Pedro. The last
is, I believe, the most southern point at which such remains have been found in
this State.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Falkenau read a paper on Peat, in which he gave an account
of the origin, distribution and uses of this material. In the discussion
which followed the reading of this communication, it was stated
by Mr. Bolander that no valuable beds of peat had yet been discovered
on this coast. Messrs. Keyes and Behr also commented
on supposed discoveries of this material in California. The peculiar
climate of this region was noticed as unfavorable to the development
of this material.</p>

<p>Dr. H. Gibbon made some remarks on the simultaneity of storms
on both sides of this continent.</p>

<p>Prof. Whitney made some remarks supplementary to his communication
to the Academy in 1862, on the question—“Which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
highest mountain in the United States, and which in North America?”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He remarked that but little had been done, outside of California, during
the last five years, towards improving our knowledge of the topography of the
western part of our continent. Some valuable contributions to the physical
geography of the central portion of the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains,
have been published by Drs. C. C. Parry and Engelmann in the Transactions
of the St. Louis Academy, (1863 and 1866) and several peaks were measured
by Dr. Parry; but of these only two are located on any map, namely: Long’s
and Pike’s. Of these Long’s Peak is 13,456 feet, and Pike’s, 14,215; this latter
being the highest summit in the Rocky Mountain range, at least within the borders
of our own territory. Of the continuation of the Rocky Mountains north
into British Columbia, but little is known. Some peaks are said to be 16,000
feet and over in height; but it is believed that no accurate measurements have
been made in that region; and, further, it is not at all in accordance with what
we have learned of the relation of peaks to passes in other mountain chains, to
suppose that when the passes are as low as 5,000 feet, the mountains on either
hand should rise to an altitude of 16,000 feet. This would be more probable
were the high points volcanic cones; but this they are not supposed to be.
Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle’s book, recently published, gives no information as
to the height of the peaks near the pass traversed by their party, (the Leather
Head Pass) except a statement that one point, far exceeding all others in elevation,
was “from 10,000 to 15,000 feet high.”</p>

<p>Professor Whitney referred again to the fact that the height of Mt. St. Elias,
as given on the British Admiralty charts, and probably from Sir Edward Belcher’s
measurement, namely, 14,970 feet, was still ignored by all compilers of
gazetteers and geographies, even down to Ansted’s latest work, published in
1867. The old figures, 17,854 feet, obtained from an old Spanish document
found in Mexico by Humboldt, have been shown to be grossly exaggerated by
two separate measurements of more modern times.</p>

<p>The recent measurement of Mt. Hood by Mr. A. Wood, was mentioned, and
several reasons given why little weight should be attached to it. If Mr. Wood’s
measurement were correct, the height of Mt. Hood must be nearly 4,000 feet
greater than that of Mt. Shasta, and so notable a fact would have been clearly
recognized by explorers, as it always has been that Mt. Shasta itself is
nearly that much higher than Lassen’s Peak. But, on the other hand, experienced
observers have stated that Mt. Hood was not as high as Mt. Shasta, nor as
Mt. Adams, or Mt. Rainier, this last-named peak being, according to Wilkes,
only 12,300 feet. Again, Mt. Hood was roughly measured by Dr. Vansant,
and his result (11,934 feet) gives the height of that mountain as less than that
of Mt. Adams, also measured by him with the same instrument, and this instrument
could hardly have been so rough and liable to error as the one employed
by Mr. Wood. Further, this last-named gentleman gives the limit of forest
vegetation on Mt. Hood as 9,000 feet, while our careful observations on Mt.
Shasta place it on that mountain, at 8,000 feet. It is certainly contrary to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
we have everywhere on this coast observed, to suppose that the limit to which
arboreal growth reaches, should not fall considerably in going north three hundred
miles, rather than rise 1,000 feet, as would be the case if Mr. Wood’s measurements
were correct. Finally, that Mr. Wood’s figures are not very reliable
is shown by the fact, that on plotting his estimates of distances traveled and
the angles of the slopes as given by him, it was found that, to correspond with
his statements, the mountain must be no less than 33,400 feet high.</p>

<p>Finally, Professor Whitney concluded that we have as yet no satisfactory
evidence to invalidate the statement previously made by him, that we have in
California the highest mountains in the United States, and the grandest and
largest mountain mass in North America, although one or two of the volcanic
cones of Mexico rise to higher altitudes than any of our peaks.</p>

</div>

<p>Prof. Whitney also exhibited one of the short barometers made
for the Geological Survey, by James Green, of New York. Having
had occasion to work at high elevations—the party being sometimes,
for weeks together, camped at from 8,000 to 10,000 feet
above the sea—it has been found that the vacuum in the ordinary
barometer tubes soon becomes deteriorated, and the mercury dirty
from the constant lowering and raising of the column, which is required
when a large number of observations are taken at so great
an elevation. By having the barometer tube made only long enough
to commence the reading at about twenty-four inches, or at an elevation
of 6,000 or 7,000 feet, the difficulty above specified is to a
great degree avoided, and the instrument made much more portable
and convenient to carry, especially on peaks so steep that both
hands are needed to aid in climbing. Two of these short barometers
have been used in the high mountain work of the California
Survey, and found extremely convenient. Of course the short barometer
must be compared with a long one at some station camp of
sufficiently great elevation to allow this to be done.</p>

<p>Dr. Gibbons made some remarks on the inferior quality of the
macadamizing material employed in this city. He inquired if any
person knew of the existence of any better stone for this purpose,
in the vicinity of San Francisco. Prof. Whitney replied that an
excellent basaltic rock was to be had in great abundance near Petaluma,
at a point convenient for shipment, and that there was no
really valuable rock for macadamizing to be had nearer than this
point.</p>

<p>In that invaluable work to the conchological student, entitled “Recent and

genera and species of land shells, and several instances are cited proving the
remarkable vitality of these comparatively insignificant animals, and their ability
to exist for great lengths of time without food.</p>

<p>Particular mention is made of a specimen of the snail <i>Helix desertorum</i>,
which was affixed to a tablet in the British Museum, March 25th, 1846, and
upon the 7th of March, 1850, it was observed that the animal must have come
out of the shell, as the paper was discolored in the attempt to get away, but
finding escape impossible, it had withdrawn inside of the shell and closed the
aperture with the usual glistening film, which led to its immersion in tepid
water and marvelous recovery. It will be noticed that this period embraced
nearly four years.</p>

<p>A more remarkable case has come under my observation, which is worthy of
mention.</p>

<p>Dr. Veatch, a member of this Academy, visited Cerros or Cedros Island,
opposite the west coast of Lower California, and upon his return, in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
1859, brought home, among other shells, a species of Helix, supposed to be
new, described by Dr. Newcomb, of Oakland, and to which the latter gave the
name of <i>Helix Veatchii</i>; many specimens of this species were obtained, and
some of them were given by Dr. Veatch to the late Thomas Bridges. Mr.
Bridges died in September, 1865, and in December of the same year a portion
of his collection passed into my hands, including the same specimens of <i>Helix
Veatchii</i> to which I have before alluded. Judge of my surprise, when one day,
upon a careful examination, I detected a living specimen, which, after being
placed in a box of moist earth, in a short time commenced crawling about,
apparently as well as ever. Fearing from its activity that by some accident it
might crawl away, and I might thus lose it, after a fortnight’s furlough from
its long imprisonment, I placed it in a pill-box, marking the date of its reimprisonment
upon the cover, in order that at some future time I may examine it,
and ascertain possibly, if it does not outlive <i>me</i>, how long a snail can live without
rations.</p>

<p>Here is an instance of a snail living at least six years—in Californian parlance,
without a single “square meal.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Bolander made some remarks in regard to the botanical collections
of Mr. Alphonso Wood, in California and Oregon, in 1866.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mr. Wood claims to have collected in five months, in California, 1,490 species
of flowering plants, as appears by a letter over his own signature in the San
Francisco Bulletin; furthermore, he also asserts, that during his whole journey
in California and Oregon he collected 15,000 specimens, representing 2,794
species of plants. This journey occupied about eleven months, including the
time spent in coming from and returning to the East. The route of Mr. Wood
was from San Diego north, through the regions which have been most thoroughly
collected over and studied by botanists, namely, along the stage road to Los
Angeles and San Bernardino, then to San Louis Obispo, Santa Cruz, and north
through the Sacramento Valley, past the base of Mount Shasta, and along the
stage road to the Columbia River. Mr. Bolander considered it probable that
there were not over 500 species of flowering plants actually existing in that part
of California explored by Mr. Wood, and in which he professes to have collected
1,490 species. According to Professor Brewer’s careful investigations, it appears
that over fifty botanists have collected in California and Oregon, during a period
extending back for more than seventy years. Some of these collectors were
engaged for years in the business, and had far greater facilities at their command
than those enjoyed by Mr. Wood, and they have jointly thoroughly explored a far
greater area than that even hastily passed over by him. Yet, the sum total of
all the species obtained, up to the time of Mr. Wood’s visit, is only about 1,800
species, while he claims to have found 2,794; that is to say, nearly 1,000 species
more than had been brought to light by fifty persons in seventy years. The
absurdity of Mr. Wood’s claims is self-evident. But, a comparison of his figures
with those of Eastern botanists will throw still further light on this subject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Professor Gray enumerates, in his manual, only 2,426 species of plants as
occurring in the eighteen Northern United States and Canada East, embracing
an area of no less than 600,000 square miles. The whole of California and
Oregon includes only about 250,000 square miles, only a very small portion of
which could have been thoroughly explored by Mr. Wood; how unlikely, then,
that he should have actually obtained, in nine months, 368 species more on
250,000 square miles, than all the botanists of the East have found on more
than double that area. Mr. Bolander also brought forward ample evidence to
show that Mr. Wood was not competent to determine how many new species he
had collected, proving by the written statements of Dr. Kellogg, and others,
that he was not acquainted with some of the most common and easily recognized
genera of this coast.</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Gibbons made some remarks on the rain-fall of this region
during the last seventeen years.</p>

<p>Mr. Gutzkow exhibited a sheet of metallic silver of three feet in
diameter, and about three ounces Troy weight, which had the appearance
and consistency of white writing paper. It was taken
from the surface of a lead-lined tank, in which a solution of protoxide
of iron was saturated, near the boiling point, with sulphate
of silver. If the temperature of the solution is maintained at a
certain height, sheet after sheet can be stripped off from the surface.
The silver thus obtained, is, after washing with muriatic acid
to free it from the iron solution, chemically pure, and by its peculiar
shape and purity, well adapted to serve as proof silver for
assaying purposes. The experiment will work only when operating
on a rather large scale, so as to prevent the too sudden cooling
of the solution. The chemical action to which it is due is the oxydation
of the protoxide of iron into sesquioxide at the expense of
the oxygen combined with the silver. This oxydation, which is
known to precipitate the silver as a whitish powder, begins to take
place only at a certain temperature below the boiling point, and is
made, in the above experiment, to act on the crystals of sulphate of
silver separating on the surface of the slowly cooling solution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>The West Coast Helicoid Land Shells.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. G. COOPER, M.D.</p>

<p>In the article on p. 259, Vol. III, of these Proceedings for April 2d, 1866,
I suggested a division of the Californian Banded Helices into five subgenera,
founded on the shells alone. Since then, Mr. G. W. Tryon has published a
synopsis of all of them except <i>H. facta</i> in his “Journal of Conchology,” Vol. II,
Part 4, for October, 1866, arranging them in the “genera” <i>Aglaia</i>, <i>Arianta</i> and
<i>Polymita</i>, but differing essentially from Albers and other authors in the species
he assigns to these groups. The types of these subgenera, however, differ so
much from our species that it is easy to separate the shells by good subgeneric
characters; and as they inhabit respectively South America, Europe, and Cuba,
it is very probable that the animals differ still more. Until these have been
compared, we may well hesitate in referring ours to the same groups, and must
for the present be guided by the shells alone.</p>

<p>In examining these, the most striking and almost universal character we find
is the presence of a dark band, generally pale margined, on one or both sides,
and situated at or close to the breathing aperture in the animal’s mantle, apparently
having some physiological connection with this opening. It is too uniform
and general to be merely an ornamental marking, such as we find in many
species, especially the tropical, which usually show no uniformity in the arrangement
of their bands.</p>

<p>The next most constant characters are those derived from the nature of the
surface, whether hirsute, with revolving grooves, smooth or variously sculptured,
with wrinkles, zigzag or oblique patterns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Although colors alone are usually unreliable as subgeneric characters, I am
inclined to consider them as such in the case of these and some allied species,
from their apparent connection with important organs. In fact the band, so
constant in this large series of species, takes precedence of considerable variety
of form, for the variations in outline, umbilicus, and peristome, though great
in the extremes, are so gradually shaded and blended together in the whole
series that no well-defined generic divisions can be founded on them, though
useful for the minor grouping. The umbilicus especially is variable even in
specimens of the same species, those from southern and arid regions being often
nearly imperforate, and more conical than others.</p>

<p>Several Mexican species belong to the same series, such as <span class="smcap">H. Remondii</span> <i>Tryon</i>,
<span class="smcap">H. Griseola</span> <i>Pfeiff</i>, and <span class="smcap">H. Berlandieriana</span> <i>Moric.</i>, the two last extending to
Texas. Others, as <span class="smcap">H. Humboldtiana</span> <i>Val.</i>, scarcely differ from the typical
<i>Pomatia</i> in form. I would, however, exclude the true <i>Hygromias</i> associated with
these by Tryon. I would also exclude the plain or variegated species of Lower
California, which approach nearer to <i>Polymita</i>. It must be observed that many
of our species approach in form to others of allied groups, so that if we overlook
characters of color and surface, we will be inclined to place in the same groups,
Nos. 40 and 52, 24 and 32, 29 and 47, etc. Even in color Nos. 32 to 35 show an
approach to the group of Lower California, but seem more closely allied to our
series, having merely a geographical affinity to the former. Size is of little
value, even as a specific character among the land shells, nearly all the species
furnishing specimens twice as large as others of the same kind. The proportions
of height to breadth are more reliable, but not constant.</p>

<p>The subgenus or division characterized by the band is scarcely distinguishable
as a whole from the typical <i>Helix</i>, (type <i>pomatia</i>) of Europe, though the
extremes vary greatly, simulating the three or more foreign genera to which
various authors have attached them.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Our species are distinct enough among themselves when the true specific
characters here given are noted, though occasionally hybrids undoubtedly occur.
Dr. W. Newcomb has raised many specimens in his garden in Oakland, combining
the characters of Nos. 24, 25, 29, 31, and 43, in such manner that it is
often impossible to determine which they belong to. Yet their natural locations
are usually so widely separated that only occasionally can hybrids occur in a
state of nature, and where several do inhabit one locality, as 24, 27, 28, 46 do at
Santa Cruz, though nearly allied, intermediate forms are not found. Some of
the so-called species are, however, scarcely more than hybrids or varieties, but
the names are retained as indicating their differences, though almost every species
is divisible into varieties as well marked or better. Thus the specimen described
on p. 260 of this volume (from Mount Diablo) seems to be a hybrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
between <i>mormonum</i> and <i>ramentosa</i>, and we also find specimens connecting the
latter with 25, 26, and perhaps others.</p>

<p>Occasional links also occur, connecting many others of the banded species together.</p>

<p>A similar intermixing of species, where nearly allied, occurs among our marine
shells wherever two or more encroach on each other’s limits; but the comparative
rarity of the intermediate forms seems to indicate hybridity rather than
specific identity of their allies.</p>

<p>It is probable that groups X and XI and XIII and XIV should be united, as the
distinctive characters between them are not of first importance, and species of each
are very closely similar otherwise. Parallel columns may be formed, as indicated
on p. 260, in which close resemblances in form, number of whorls, etc., between
species of the different groups may be shown, and this may be extended so as
to show analogous parallels with those of other sub-families, or even families,
but these resemblances do not indicate affinity, though very likely to mislead.
A geographical arrangement of some groups is also indicated, though imperfectly,
as there are no impassable limits between them. For special localities of
many species, see vol. III, pp. 62, 115, 180, 259, and II, 91, 103.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The Darwinian theory of development might be very beautifully illustrated by
these banded snails, if we could find evidence that their various forms had all originated
from a common stock (which might be the <i>ramentosa</i>, as that species now
occupies a nearly central locality). But though fossil forms have been found
differing considerably from their present representatives, there are others apparently
as old, which show no such differences, and none of them show a tendency
towards any common original type. The one referred to by Professor Whitney
on p. 278, as found with the human skull of supposed pliocene (?) age, does
not differ perceptibly from specimens of <i>mormonum</i>, now living near the locality.
It retains even its band of color, which is soon lost in specimens imbedded
near the surface, and this (if not preserved by its deep burial or incrustation)
is strong evidence against a great antiquity of the skull. All other fossil Helicoids
are considered postpliocene, at least so far as known in this State, though
extinct species occur in Europe as far back as the Eocene.</p>

<p>The bandless species of the west coast slope, from lat. 33° to 49°, are added
to the synopsis, to show their relations and analogies with the banded. The
arrangement followed is essentially that of Tryon, except the addition of some
he has omitted, or not yet published. The generic divisions are also reduced to
groups, as the true generic characters are not yet settled. The lip is entirely
wanting in the first family, but in the bandless <i>Helicidæ</i> of this coast, it becomes
of great importance for grouping of species, (49 to 55) of which we have very
few, while east of the Rocky Mountains there are more than fifty. Group III
is also largely developed on the Atlantic slopes. The tendency now is
to divide too much, which is as unnatural as to unite all under genus <span class="smcap">Helix</span>,
as many still do. It is probable that the divisions here called subfamilies, answer
more nearly to the true genera than any others, though they require modification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
and the selection of names applicable to them as genera, is a difficult
task. To undertake to distinguish genera by the lingual teeth, mucous pores,
or any other single character of the soft parts, is less practicable than to do it
by the shells alone, and little if any more reliable. There may, however, be
foreign shells closely resembling ours in form, which must still be separated on
account of the animal.</p>

<p>I have omitted most of the compound terms used by authors to describe the
forms or shells, as they are not used with any uniform system, and do not well
define the differences between the various species of the same group. The
dimensions are more reliable for separating allied forms. “Striæ” is also an
indefinite term, used by various authors for lines of growth, revolving grooves
or stripes of color, and is therefore never used alone in this article.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that no <i>reversed</i> species or variety has yet been found west
of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Origin of the Submerged Forests in the Columbia River,
Oregon.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>The submerged forests of fir trees, extending about twenty-five miles along
the Columbia River, above the Cascades, have long excited the curiosity of
travelers upon that stream. The trees stand erect as they grew, but the tops
have decayed and broken off, leaving only those portions of the trees that have
been protected from the air by the covering of water. At extreme high-water
very few of these old trunks can be seen, but at low-water they appear in great
numbers, and project a few inches or feet above the surface, and in some places
they extend far out into the stream.</p>

<p>These trees are not petrified, as is supposed by many. The outer portions
are much softened and partly decayed, but towards the heart the wood is sound,
and appears to be identical in character with the fir which covers the mountains
around. Some cedar stumps are also found.</p>

<p>It is well known that fir trees will not grow below the high-water mark of
our streams, or where the roots would be subject to overflows. Flooding the
roots of the fir even for a few days is sufficient to destroy its life. It is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
clear that there has been a change in the level of the water since the forests
grew. Either the land has sunk or the water has been raised: the latter appears
to have been the fact.</p>

<p>The river at the Cascades, just below the submerged forests, plunges over
great masses of a hard volcanic conglomerate, which forms the base of the cliffs
on each side. This conglomerate, which is 150 to 200 feet thick, rests upon a
stratum of sandy clay. This stratum is much softer than the conglomerate, and
yields more rapidly to the action of running water. It may be seen when the
water is low, at the foot of the Cascades, with the hard conglomerate overhanging
it in large masses.</p>

<p>From all these facts, it appears that the river, in cutting its way downwards
through the Cascade Range, reached this soft substratum, and for a long time
flowed in a comparatively unobstructed channel at a much lower level than now,
thus permitting the forests to grow along its banks. The extensive undermining
of the conglomerate caused it at length to fall into the stream, and this,
together with the sliding in of the banks upon this soft foundation, I regard as
forming the obstruction which dammed the waters and caused the overflow of
the forests above.</p>

<p>The mountains rise on each side to a height of 2,500 or 3,000 feet, and are
composed of nearly horizontal beds of lava. One of these mountains on the
right bank, or Washington Territory side, presents vertical cliffs towards the
Cascades, and these cliffs have a <i>freshly broken</i> appearance, as if a large part of
the mountain had <i>broken off</i> at no very remote period. The surface of the
country between this cliff and the Cascades is very much broken, and the railroad
which traverses it, exposes enormous masses of the conglomerate, piled confusedly
together as if they had been hurled down by a land-slide. Mr. Brazee,
the engineer of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, informs me that the
ground is in constant motion toward the river, and it has necessitated the relaying
of the track within the past year. The same phenomena have been observed
on the left bank, or Oregon side. The bank is in constant motion there, and at
low-water a fine blue clay may be seen rising in the channel, as if crowded out
by the pressure of the rocks above. As there has not been any perceptible
change of level in the stream for years past, we may conclude that the erosive
action of the current is fully equal to the encroachment of the banks.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Columbia have a tradition of a great convulsion at the
Cascades. They assert that the Chinook canoes formerly ascended the river as
far as a water-fall at the Dalles, passing, at the Cascades, <i>under a bridge of rock</i>.
This bridge, or arch of rock, they say, fell in at the time of a quarrel between
the two mountains, Mt. Hood and St. Helen’s, and at the same time the waterfall
at the Dalles was destroyed, so that salmon could ascend to the Upper
Columbia. Before that the fall was so high that salmon could not get up, and
all the upper country Indians were obliged to go to the Dalles for their supply.</p>

<p>The general accuracy of this tradition seems highly probable. The Dalles
are now a succession of rapids and low falls, in a narrow channel, between
vertical walls of basaltic lava. There is very little fall or current in the river
below the Dalles to the Cascades, and the elevation of the water by an obstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
at the latter point would in all probability affect the height of the lower
fall at the Dalles.</p>

<p>The sandy substratum of the coarse conglomerate at the Cascades is evidently
an old river or beach deposit. It is accompanied by layers of round water-worn
rocks, and is filled with trunks of trees lying prostrate. These trees are fossilized.
Some of them are half coal and half stone. The central portions are
usually coal-like or carbonized, and the outer parts silicified. They vary in size,
from a few inches to six feet in diameter, and are nearly all flattened by pressure.
This stratum is evidently the source of the great quantities of silicified wood
which are found about the Cascades.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Stearns read the following note on a large specimen of
<i>Orthagoriscus analis</i>, Ayres:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In passing through the Italian Fish Market in this City, in the month of
October, 1866, I noticed an unusually large specimen of <i>Orthagoriscus analis</i>,
commonly called “Sun Fish,” described by Dr. Ayres on page 31 of Vol. II
of the Academy Proceedings. Curiosity led me to make a measurement, which
I find in my note-book as follows: length from snout to extreme caudal point,
5 feet 8¼ inches; from tip of dorsal to tip of anal fin, 7 feet 6 inches. I found
the anal and dorsal fins to be nearly the same length, measuring from the tip to
junction with body 23 inches. Weight, as stated by the fishermen, 632 pounds.
It will be seen that the measurement from tip to tip of fins as above, exceeds
the length by 21¾ inches.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Stearns made the following remarks as to the true habitat of
<i>Helix Ayresiana</i>, Newc.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On page 103, Vol. II, of the Academy’s Proceedings, may be found, under
date of March 18th, 1861, the description by Dr. W. Newcomb of a <i>Helix H.
Ayresiana</i>, the habitat of which was, as I learn from Dr. N., doubtfully assigned
at that time to “Northern Oregon.” Recently Dr. Newcomb has himself detected
it on Santa Cruz Island, off the Coast of California, near Santa Barbara.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Whitney exhibited a sample of the coal used at Salt
Lake City, taken by Mr. Ives, chief of one of the Central Pacific
Railroad surveying parties, from a wagon on its way from the
mines to the city. The locality from which it was obtained is in
Webber Cañon, and the geological age of the deposit is supposed
to be cretaceous. The quality of the coal seems to be good; but
nothing very definite could be communicated in regard to the extent
or geological position of the bed.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney also exhibited a specimen of very pure rock
salt, obtained from the Salt Mountain on the Muddy River, a
branch of the Virgin, nearly a hundred miles south of Pahranagat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
by Major S. S. Lyon, formerly of the Kentucky Geological
Survey. Major Lyon being present, at the request of the President,
gave an account of this interesting locality, which is one long
known to explorers. He stated that the Salt Mountain lies on both
sides of the Muddy River, and rises 400 feet above that stream.
The locality is about thirty miles northeast of Colville, and twenty
from the Colorado. Major Lyon also gave some facts in regard to
the geology of the vicinity of Pahranagat, where he had been residing
for some months past.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney presented two analyses of ores from the Comstock
Lode, Virginia City, Nevada, made by Professor Domeyko,
of Santiago, Chile, and communicated by Mr. Rémond, who is now
residing in that place. They are as follows:</p>

<p>The name of the mine from which they were taken was not
given.</p>

<p>Mr. Yale brought up the subject of the gold mines in Africa,
supposed to be worked by the Emperor Napoleon III, and kept
secret from the world in general. A discussion ensued, in the
course of which Professor Whitney and Mr. Ashburner expressed
their doubts as to the possibility of the locality of any extensive
mining operations being long concealed, and their disbelief in the
truth of newspaper statements to this effect.</p>

<h3>List of Shells collected at Purissima and Lobitas, California,
October, 1866.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ROBERT E. C. STEARNS, CURATOR OF CONCHOLOGY, CAL. ACAD. NAT. SCIENCES.</p>

<p>“Purissima” and “Lobitas” are the names of two creeks situated a few miles
south of Spanish Town, in San Mateo County. Near the points where these
streams empty into the ocean are small beaches and groups of flat rocks left

is for the most part exceedingly bold and precipitous, the ocean at ordinary
high water beating against the base of the cliffs.</p>

<h3>Note upon the Brown Coal Formation of Washington Territory
and Oregon.</h3>

<p class="center">BY WM. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>Openings recently made in the coal formations along the Cowlitz River have
shown the existence of several seams of brown coal, ranging from two to seven
feet in thickness. They are separated by layers of sandstone, and are underlaid
by a pebbly conglomerate.</p>

<p>The seven-foot seam contains a few partings of clay about six inches thick,
but is chiefly a very compact coal, which breaks out in large blocks with a
conchoidal fracture. It is very tough, and is not easily broken. It has the
appearance of cannel or splint coal. Exposure to the sun and air causes it to
shrink and crack.</p>

<p>It burns freely, giving a luminous flame, and a light smoke, similar to that
from wood. The ignited coals hold fire in a remarkable manner, and with a
strong draught or blast give an intense heat. A single fragment, when ignited,
will continue to burn slowly to the center under an envelope of ash. A sun-dried
sample gave me 50.8 per cent. of volatile matter, chiefly gas. The residue
was a brilliant coke, the fragments of which were slightly adherent, thus
showing a tendency to cake. Trials of the coal in quantity in open grates
failed, however, to show any caking qualities. Some portions of the coal expand
when burning and give a porous coke, which in many respects resembles
ordinary charcoal.</p>

<p>This deposit appears to be formed in great part of trunks of exogenous trees.
One trunk has been cut through that was over four feet in thickness: a part
of this was compact coal, and another portion was in a half silicified state.
Lines of annual growth may be seen in some of the samples. This combustible
partakes of the characters of both coal and wood, and is in fact a highly condensed
wood, carbonized, without the loss of its volatile portions.</p>

<p>Fossil plants are found in abundance in the adjoining sandy beds. They are
chiefly leaves of deciduous trees, but there are some very distinct impressions
of palms. This is significant of a warmer climate.</p>

<p>The same formation of brown coal appears to extend along the Columbia,
back of St. Helen’s, where it is in close proximity to beds of iron ore, and the
coal may perhaps be used to great advantage in the production of that metal.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Mt. Diablo (California) Coal.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. P. BLAKE.</p>

<p>A sample of Mt. Diablo coal, from the Pittsburg mine, was analyzed by me
in January last, with the following results:</p>

<table summary="Composition of the coal sample">
  <tr>
    <td>Water</td>
    <td class="tdr">3.28</td>

    <td>Bituminous substances</td>

</table>

<p>The sample was very pure, and apparently free from sulphur. Color black.
Fracture sub-conchoidal, giving brilliant shining surfaces. It is very brittle,
and is easily reduced to powder in a mortar. Streak, dark brown.</p>

<p>This coal does not fuse so as to cake and make a compact mass of coke. It
is not therefore an economical coal for gas production. It gives a long flame
in burning; parts with its gas rapidly and breaks up into small fragments, thus
necessitating the use of grate-bars with narrow openings. The above analysis
differs from those hitherto published, chiefly in the amount of water and gas.
Former analyses give from thirteen to fourteen per cent. of water.</p>

<h3>Notice of a peculiar mode of the occurrence of Gold and Silver
in the Foot-Hills of the Sierra Nevada, and especially
at Whisky Hill, in Placer County, and Quail Hill, in Calaveras
County, California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY B. SILLIMAN.</p>

<p>In the search for ores of copper which occurred in California in what is now
known as the “Copper Belt” of the Lower Sierras, deposits of “Iron Rust,” as
they were called by the miners, were observed at numerous points far below the
range of the main gold belt of the Sierras. Several of these ochraceous deposits
had been previously “located” by prospecting miners for gold, before there was
any knowledge, or suspicion even, of the existence of ores of copper in connection
with them. It was a matter of common observation that certain gulches, or
watercourses in the neighborhood of these rusty deposits, were rich in placer gold,
having been worked for gold from an early date. The search for copper in
this kind of deposit was not commercially successful, although there were shipments
of green and blue carbonates of copper, red oxide and metallic copper, to
a limited extent from both the localities here referred to, the metal from which
was known to contain a notable value of gold and silver, stated to be about
fifty dollars to the ton of ore. This search for copper has, however, opened up
these deposits so as to display their character in a conspicuous manner.</p>

<p>The rocks appear to have been originally talcose and chloritic schists, sometimes
micaceous, inclosing masses of argillite, and of quartz which appears to
have been massive enough at certain points to assume the character of a vein,
and parallel to the stratification which has the usual north-western strike and
easterly dip of the region. All this mass of material which at Quail Hill is certainly
three hundred feet wide, and possibly twice that, and with a linear extent
exceeding one thousand feet, appears to have been very highly impregnated or
mineralized by sulphurets, chiefly of iron, with a portion of copper, zinc and
lead. The sulphurets have undergone almost total decomposition throughout the
entire mass, leaving soft ochraceous deposits of a rusty red and yellow color, and
staining the rocks with brilliant colors, a peculiarity which the miners have
characterized by the name of “Calico rocks.” This decomposition or oxidation
of the sulphurets, has extended to a point as low as atmospheric influences
extend, or probably to a point where water is permanently found, which at
Quail Hill is assumed to be about 170 feet below the outcrop of the mass, or
crest of the hill. Dykes of porphyry and of other rocks, commonly called
intrusive, are seen dividing these great ore channels in a direction conformable
to the line of strike. But the decomposition which has affected other portions
of the ore channel, appears also to have changed them, for they are found
to be reduced completely to the condition of kaolin and lithomarge, or kindred
alterations of feldspathic rocks. The outlines of the feldspar crystals are
still easily distinguished, although the mass of the dykes is completely friable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>The zinc blende which is found in small quantities at Whisky Hill, and the vitreous
copper also to some extent, appear to have escaped decomposition. The
copper ores appear to have been confined to a portion of the deposit, as is indicated
in the section exhibited, while the auriferous sulphuret of iron has been
co-extensive with the ore channel, the cubical cavities left by the decay of its
crystals being found in all the outcrops both in the quartz and in the ‘calico
rocks,’ resulting from the decomposition of feldspathic and talcose or chloritic
constituents.</p>

<p>Accompanying the entire mass of decomposition at both localities, occur
both gold and silver, disseminated with remarkable uniformity in all parts of
the orey ground. At Whisky Hill, films of metallic silver are visible upon
the talcose masses stained green by malachite or chrysocolla; the gold is rarely
seen in situ, being mostly obscured by the very rusty and highly-stained character
of the associated materials. But it is rare that on washing a small quantity
of any of the contents of these great deposits, gold is not found in angular
grains or small ragged masses, from the size of a few grains’ weight, to
impalpable dust. Nuggets of several pennyweights occur occasionally. This
gold has evidently accompanied the sulphurets and been left in its present position
and condition by their decomposition. There can be little doubt that the
gold of the gulches adjoining these deposits has been derived from them. At
Whisky Hill, the gulch gold ceases to be found as soon as the limits of this
deposit are passed, and the same is true at Quail Hill. The occurrence of deposits
of this nature throughout the range of the foot-hills, seems to offer the best
solution which has suggested itself of the origin of the placer gold which is
found in situations so far removed from the gold belt of the upper Sierras, and
away from sources usually recognized as those to which placer gold may be
referred.</p>

<p>Experiments made by myself and by others on a considerable scale, the details
of which will appear elsewhere, show that the amount of the precious
metals disseminated in the average mass of vein stuff and decomposed materials
of every name at Quail Hill, is considerably in excess of the general average
tenor of gold veins in California. The mean of my own trials gave to the
ton of 2,000 lbs. by assay:</p>

<table summary="Results of Professor Silliman’s trials">
  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td class="tdr">$35.14</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Silver</td>
    <td class="tdr">15.08</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="tdr total">$50.22</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>While from the working of carefully prepared averages in considerable quantity
by milling process, the tenor of the precious metals was:</p>

<table summary="Results of Professor Silliman’s trials">
  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td class="tdr">$29.18</td>

    <td class="tdr">5.91</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="tdr total">$35.09</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The extremely friable condition of the entire mass of these auriferous materials
renders their extraction and treatment easy and comparatively inexpensive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>At Whisky Hill, a mill of forty stamps has been set up which is now running
with satisfactory returns. The cost by contract of delivery of the ores to the
mill, being stated at forty cents (40c.) per ton, the cost of mining and treatment
in mill being considerably less, it is said, than one dollar per ton, the
amount treated being five tons to each stamp.</p>

<p>The chemical results of the extensive decomposition of metallic sulphids
which has in former times occurred at these localities, offer an interesting problem
in chemical geology. The sulphur has been removed chiefly as sulphuric
acid beyond doubt, which has combined with iron and copper to form sulphates
of these metals. These have for the most part disappeared, being washed out
by the atmospheric waters, and have followed the drainage of the country.
At Whisky Hill I found the sulphate of iron, (Coquimbite) sulphate of copper,
(Cyanosite) and alum. The water of the shaft contains copper enough to
redden the iron tools. At Quail Hill considerable masses of heavy spar are
found, formed probably from the action of soluble sulphates upon witherite.
No gypsum was observed at either locality.</p>

<p>The mineral species observed at Whisky Hill, are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Metallic Gold.</li>
<li>Metallic Copper.</li>
<li>Metallic Silver.</li>
<li>Red Copper.</li>
<li>Malachite (Green Carbonate of Copper).</li>
<li>Azurite (Blue Carbonate of Copper).</li>
<li>Chrysocolla (Silicate of Copper).</li>
<li>Cyanosite (Blue Vitriol).</li>
<li>Copper Glance (Vitreous Copper).</li>
<li>Zinc blende.</li>
<li>Galena.</li>
<li>Iron pyrites.</li>
<li>Alum.</li>
<li>Coquimbite.</li>
<li>Heavy Spar.</li>
<li>Hematite (chiefly the earthy varieties).</li>
<li>Kaolin.</li>
<li>Lithomarge and various aluminous and magnesian silicates resulting from the decomposition of the chloritic and talcose rocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of species is about the same for the deposit at Quail Hill.</p>

<p>The line of division between the ore-bearing ground in these great ore channels,
and the country rock is quite distinctly seen on both the eastern and western
outcrop at Quail Hill, and on the western at Whisky Hill. At the former
place it is a dark bluish porphyritic rock, probably metamorphic, of a sandstone
or silicious sediment. The outcroppings resemble those of many quartz veins,
and I find the moss-covered portions of this quartzose matter full of cavities,
resulting from the decay of pyrites, and yielding, by assay, three to five dollars
to the ton in bullion.</p>

<p>From all the evidence presented, we seem justified in regarding these remarkable
metallic deposits as segregated veins, holding a pretty uniform and high
tenor of gold and silver, associated with and derived from the decomposition of
extended masses of metallic sulphurets and quartzose matter, and carrying at
times, ores of copper, the commercial value of which is, however, entirely subordinate
to that of the precious metals which are found to characterize these veins
or ore channels.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns presented, in behalf of Mr. Rowell, the following
description of a new species of <i>Pisidium</i>, collected during the
field excursion to Angel Island:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Description of a New Species of Pisidium.</h3>

<p class="center">BY J. ROWELL.</p>

<h4><i>Pisidium angelicum</i>, Rowell.</h4>

<p>Shell rounded oval, nearly equilateral, very convex; margin well rounded;
beaks very slightly raised and very approximate; surface subgranulate, marked
with from one to six very decided striæ or lines of growth; teeth too minute
for observation.</p>

<p>Long. (of largest) 2 mill., Lat. 1.5 mill.; Diam. 1 mill.</p>

<p><i>Habitat</i>: Angel Island.</p>

<p>Of California species, it is most like <i>P. abditum</i>, but differs in its sculpture,
its less prominent beaks and its more globular and equilateral form. Most
specimens are covered by an exceedingly persistent coat of jet black mud, making
examination of them very difficult; but some are perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns read the following note upon a recent</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h3>Exhibition of Parhelia.</h3>

<p>On Wednesday, the 17th day of (April) last month, at about 5 o’clock in the
afternoon, my attention was attracted towards the heavens by an exhibition of
the rather unusual phenomena (unusual in this latitude) known as <i>Parhelia</i>.</p>

<p>The sky in the west at the time was somewhat cloudy, and the atmosphere
hazy. I was unable to determine the exact position of the sun, but its altitude
was approximately 22° above the horizon; the diameter of the circle or halo
was about 24°. A horizontal line, drawn through the sun and projected sufficiently
in a northerly and southerly direction to intersect the halo, displayed at
each point of intersection, a <i>parhelion</i> or mock sun of very considerable brilliancy,
and continued for upwards of half an hour.</p>

<p>A much more extensive display of these phenomena was witnessed by me in
the month of April, 1858, while residing near Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The sun was not far from the zenith, surrounded by a single broad halo,
which latter was in turn inclosed by an outer circle of many halos all intersecting
with each other and with the central halo—each of the numerous points
of intersection gemmed with a <i>parhelion</i>. So extensive was the display, owing
to the number of halos and the attendant <i>parhelia</i>, that the whole heavens from
the zenith to within apparently 30° of the horizon, seemed covered with brilliant
circles or rings, and resplendent with numberless suns. The sky, at the time,
was obscured by a haze of considerable density, and a chilling wind was blowing
from the south.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Some remarks followed upon sun and moon halos, during which
Dr. Gibbons combated the popular notion that halos about the moon
were infallible signs of rain. His observations proved that, in some
seasons, these signs invariably failed in California, and at the East;
he thought no rule could be established on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodyear presented the following paper in behalf of Professor
Silliman:</p>

<h3>Notice of New Localities of Diamonds in California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY B. SILLIMAN.</p>

<p>Every well-authenticated instance of the existence of the diamond in the
United States is of interest, since it serves to enlarge our knowledge of the
geographical and geological distribution of this much esteemed gem.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of exhibiting to the Academy four diamonds, obtained
from separate localities in this State. Three of them are crystals, having the
form of an icositetrahedron; the other has been cut, and is set as a ring stone.</p>

<p><i>The First Specimen</i>—Is from Forest Hill, in El Dorado County. Its weight
is 0.369 gramme, or 5.673 grains—equal to rather less than 1½ carats. Its
color is good, but it has a small cavity and discoloration on one of the solid
angles, and it is less symmetrical than the second specimen. This crystal was
found at a great depth from the surface in a tunnel run into the auriferous
gravel at Forest Hill. I procured this stone from Mr. Tucker, the well-known
jeweler.</p>

<p><i>The Second Specimen</i>—Is from French Corral, in Nevada County. It weighs
0.3375 grammes, or 5.114 grains—equal to about 1⅓ carats. Its form is symmetrical,
color slightly yellowish. Its lustre has been dimmed slightly by having
been subjected to a red heat as a test of its authenticity. The <i>auto da fé</i>
is hardly the test a chemist would select for pure carbon! It is remarkably
destitute of flaws. This crystal was washed out from the cement in the deep
gravel washings for gold at French Corral, and was found in the sluice boxes.
It belongs to Mr. Egbert Judson, of San Francisco, from whom I derive this
information.</p>

<p><i>The Third Specimen</i>—Is smaller and less perfect than either of the preceding.
It was found at Fiddletown, in Amador County. It weighs 0.2345 gramme, or
3.619 grains—a little less than one carat. This crystal is distorted, and has
several reëntering angles and cavities. Mr. M. W. Belshaw, to whom it belongs,
informs me that since 1855, five diamonds have, to his knowledge, been
found at Fiddletown, where he then resided; none of them weighing much over
one carat. All these specimens were found in a gray cemented gravel underlying
a stratum of “lava” or compact volcanic ashes, and were found in searching
for gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Fourth Specimen</i>—Is from Cherokee Flat, in Butte County, and has been
cut and set in a ring. Mr. Geo. E. Smith, of 605 Montgomery Street, San
Francisco, who is an expert in diamonds and owns the specimen exhibited, informs
me that he has seen fifteen crystals from this locality, and has authentic
advices of at least forty, all of which have been found in deep gravel washings,
and are believed to come from a stratum of about three feet thick, forming part
of a mass of twenty-five to fifty feet of superincumbent material. When this
special stratum of sandy materials is washed, the diamonds have been found. I
have taken steps to obtain an authentic crystal from this place, which appears
to be the most prolific locality of the diamond yet observed in California.</p>

<p>In the first volume of the Geology of California, page 276, Mr. Rémond is
quoted as authority for the existence of diamonds at Volcano. If this locality
is distinct from that at Fiddletown, near Volcano, we have at present, five
authenticated localities of the diamond in California, from which specimens
have been identified by mineralogists.</p>

<p>If a knowledge of the characteristics of this remarkable species was more
common among the miners who work in the deep gravel diggings, no doubt
this gem would be found to be more abundant and in more numerous places
than is now suspected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, May 6th, 1867.</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Whitney, in reply to various inquiries made by members,
remarked that there were probably some fifteen or twenty
different localities in California where diamonds had been found;
but these were all of small size, the largest which had come under
his notice weighing only 7¼ grains: this was found at French Corral,
near San Juan North. It was difficult to give any directions
by which miners could infallibly recognize the diamond when they
happened to meet with this gem. The crystalline form is very different
from that of quartz, which is now, however, much less frequently
mistaken for the diamond than it was formerly. Most of the crystals
found in California, up to this time, have been twenty-four
sided. The fact that the faces of the crystals are usually curved
instead of being plane surfaces, is also characteristic of the gem in
question. The hardness and specific gravity are also sure guides;
but miners rarely have the means of getting at either of these
characters accurately. It is commonly believed that the diamond
can be struck a heavy blow, on an anvil, without breaking; but
this is a mistake, resulting from confounding toughness with hardness.
It is extremely doubtful whether washing the gravel for
diamonds in California would pay, under any circumstances; and
it is believed that such washings are not remunerative anywhere,
except when performed by slave or convict labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Whitney read a paper on the geological position of
coal. The object of this paper was to show how completely the
results of modern geological explorations and discoveries had done
away with the old idea that valuable beds of coal are confined to
any one member of the series of geological formations. The
recent investigations of geologists in India, China, Australia, New
Zealand, South America, and on the Pacific coast of North America,
were noticed and commented on. It was shown that while the
important coal fields of Eastern Europe and the Eastern United
States are of palæozoic age, those of India, China and Australia,
on the other hand, belong to the mesozoic series chiefly, although
there are important deposits even as recent as the cainozoic or
tertiary. Professor Whitney remarked on the distribution of the
principal coal fields of the world into two great groups, on opposite
sides of the globe: one of these is of palæozoic, and the other of
mesozoic age. He referred particularly to the coal of the Pacific
coast of North America, and gave a brief account of its geographical
distribution and geological age, noticing particularly the
fact that most of the valuable fields of that region belong to the
cretaceous series, a geological formation which, in other parts of
the world, has been found to be one of the most barren in combustible
materials. In conclusion, the importance of coal discoveries
in the region between the Rocky Mountains and California
to the successful operation of the Pacific Railroad was explained,
and the hope expressed that the geological expedition recently set
on foot by the General Government, at the head of which is Mr.
King, late of the California Survey, might be the means of giving
to the world reliable information in regard to the coal resources of
that region, of which we now know so little.</p>

<p>Prof. Whitney presented an elaborate paper “On the Natural
System of the Igneous Rocks,” by Baron Richthofen; he advised
its reference to the Publication Committee, and that it should be
made one of the “Memoirs” which the Academy contemplates
publishing. It was so referred, and the committee was instructed
to report on the feasibility of commencing the publication of a
series of quarto Memoirs.</p>

<p>Prof. Whitney exhibited a canine tooth, obtained from the deep
gravel deposits at Douglas Flat, near Murphy’s, in Calaveras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
County; it appears to be different from the teeth of any animal
yet found on this coast, either living or fossil. He considered it as
probably belonging to the hyæna; if so, this was the first notice of
the occurrence of this animal on the American continent.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper stated that Mr. Ridgeway, the zoölogist appointed
to accompany the Government exploration of Russian America,
when on that coast, a few years since, had found birds nearly
identical with living species in Asia—a fact of much interest, since
none of the same species are found on the eastern coast of America.
There is here another suggestion of the former intimate relations
between Western America and Eastern Asia.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabb presented a communication on the “Geology of Lower
California,” which was referred to the Publication Committee, and
ordered printed as one of the Memoirs of the Academy.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabb also communicated the following translation of part of
a letter received by him from Sr. Don Antonio Raimondi, of Lima,
Peru, with reference to some geological features of that country:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have just received a letter from Professor Raimondi, accompanying a very
interesting collection of fossils, sent through my lamented friend Mr. Rémond,
but which I have not yet received. After remarking that he had not time to
write a detailed account of the country to assist me in my determinations of
the geological ages, he gives the following condensed but interesting description
of the country, which I have considered of sufficient value to warrant its
immediate publication. I translate this portion of the letter in full.</p>

<p>“Peru, or at least the great chain of the Cordillera which divides the whole
of America into two parts, comprises various smaller chains, often very high,
and here consisting of four, nearly parallel. The principal of these are two, one
of which is the dividing line between the waters emptying into the Pacific on
one side, and the tributaries of the Amazon on the other. This is what is
properly called the Cordillera of the Andes, or the Western Cordillera. The
other chain is called the Eastern Cordillera, and in some points is as elevated
or even surpasses in height the true Cordillera. In the southern part of Peru,
for example, it is entirely covered with perpetual snow, and contains very
elevated peaks, including, in that part which is prolonged into Bolivia, the two
colossi called Sorata, or Illampu and Illimani. The Eastern Cordillera is
of the greater geological age, appearing to be entirely composed of micaceous
and talcose schists which have been metamorphosed by the elevation of the
granites, those which have also introduced into these schists numerous veins of
quartz, which in some places are quite rich in gold. This elevated chain has
been cut very deeply by numerous rivers, which, taking their origin in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
Western Cordillera, traverse these immense formations of schists and granite
through narrow gorges, and unite to form the large affluents of the Amazon.</p>

<p>“The Western Cordillera or true chain of the Andes is made up in nearly
the whole of its length of rocks of a much more recent age. The principal
formations are Cretaceous, Jurassic, Lias and Trias. Another group of rocks,
probably Carboniferous, form the great basin of Lake Titicaca and a small
spot on the heights of Huanta. This Cordillera has been metamorphosed by
various eruptive rocks, the principal of which are porphyries and diorites.
These have introduced innumerable metalliferous veins, rich in lead, copper and
silver, and which have been worked in many places.</p>

<p>“The volcanic rocks are strongly developed in Peru, especially in the southern
part, and have never been well studied. According to my opinion, they
once formed an extensive chain, which, from its being composed of rocks easily
disintegrated, has been in great part destroyed by the action of water, so that
it is separated mostly by isolated hills; but from all that I have been able to
see, it must have formed at one time an uninterrupted chain, as it appears in
the central part of Peru, at a little distance from the Pacific Ocean, and afterwards
it approaches almost insensibly the true Cordilleras; so that, near Arequipa,
it is more than twenty leagues from the sea, but in following it to the
south it nears the Cordillera, extending to Cruzalia, in the broken country of
Moqueque and Tacna.</p>

<p>“Along the whole length of the coast, at a distance of one or two leagues
from the margin of the ocean, rises a small chain of hills formed of granite,
syenites and porphyries. This chain is called ‘the Hills’ (Lomas) and contains
in places scattered spots of copper and a very little gold. On the same coast
and on the adjacent islands, sedimentary rocks are rare, though they are nevertheless
found at rare intervals. To the north, sedimentary rocks extend from
Tumbes to the south of Payta, at the little cove of Tortugas, where there
are many springs of fresh water in a hardened claystone, alternating with
calcareous strata, which contain little seams of coal.</p>

<p>“From Secharra, to near Lima there is no sedimentary formation. Near
the port of Ancon, five leagues from Lima, in the island of San Lorenzo, near
Callao, and in Chorillo, three leagues south of Lima, there are some stratified
sandstones with a very few fossils. These formations appear to us to be either
Jurassic or Liassic, but the study of the few fossils found will determine better
their age.</p>

<p>“Near Arica, and three leagues to the interior from Iquique, where are the
celebrated silver mines of Huantapaya, there have also been noticed sedimentary
rocks belonging to the Oolite and Lias.</p>

<p>“In the elevated regions of the Cordillera are many traces of stone coal
which, unlike those in the formation about Lake Titicaca, which I have already
said belong to the true Carboniferous, are all of more recent age, belonging to
the Jurassic and Liassic, as you will see by specimens from the Springs of
Pariatambo.”</p>

<p>A letter from George Gibbs, Esq., transmitted through the
Smithsonian, and urging the importance of collecting Indian
crania on this coast, was read and commented on by Professor
Whitney. He also exhibited a part of a jaw of <i>Oreodon</i>, sent from
Montana, by Mr. Keyes. The precise locality where it was said to
have been found is about twenty miles northeast of Bannock City,
on Rattlesnake Creek, a branch of the Beaver Head. If there is
no mistake in the locality, this is a very interesting occurrence,
as the existence of these tertiary deposits characterized by bones of
extinct mammalia (the White River beds) was not before known
as far west, or at as high an elevation, as this.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney gave an account of his recent visit to Oregon,
Washington Territory, Vancouver Island, and British Columbia.
He spoke particularly of the volcanoes of that region, and remarked
that he had ascertained, by rough trigonometrical measurements,
that Mount Hood was at least two thousand feet lower than Mount
Shasta. He was about to ascend the first-named peak, in order to
measure it barometrically; but, on learning that Colonel Williamson
was intending to do the same thing, during the present season, he
proposed to await that gentleman’s measurement, the result of which
could not fail to be accepted by all as eminently trustworthy.
Professor Whitney remarked that his journey had been undertaken
chiefly with a view to the study of the “surface-geology,” and that
he would, on a future occasion, bring before the Academy the results
of his observations.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander made some remarks on the distribution of the redwoods
and Big Trees in California, and exhibited a map, prepared
at the office of the Geological Survey, on which the extent and
position of the regions occupied by these two species of Sequoia
were shown by colors.</p>

<p>Dr. Ayres remarked on explosive sounds heard by him recently,

<h3>On the Height of Mt. Hood.</h3>

<p class="center">BY R. S. WILLIAMSON.</p>

<p>Having recently formed a party and visited Mt. Hood for the purpose of
ascertaining its altitude, and as my determination of its height is much less than
previous parties have made it, I think it proper to state somewhat in detail the
nature of the observations and the method I have pursued to arrive at the number
I adopt as a close approximation to its true height.</p>

<p>By the kindness of Gen. F. Steele, commanding the Department of the
Columbia, the necessary transportation was furnished for the party, consisting
of twelve persons, of whom my two assistants, Lieut. W. H. Heuer, U. S.
Engineers, and Mr. John T. Best, were specially charged with the observations
on the summit. We left Portland, Oregon, August 20th, and on the evening of
the twenty-second arrived at a place on the slope of the mountain, where we
camped, and from which, the next day, the ascent was made; seven of the party
attempting to reach, and six reaching, the summit, where they remained from
one and a-half to three hours.</p>

<p>From this camp to the summit and back ten hours were occupied, starting at
7:30, <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> The weather was clear and pleasant, and had been so for several
days before, and was so for several days after.</p>

<p>The instruments used at all the stations were made by James Green, of New
York, were in perfect order, and most of them new. They consisted of cistern
barometers reading to two thousandths of an inch, with attached thermometer,
and open air thermometer, (dry and wet) with large divisions, so that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
easily read to tenths of a degree. All the barometers had been adjusted to or
compared with the standard, and all agreed with it except the one at Astoria,
which required a plus correction of three thousandths of an inch.</p>

<p>The stations used were Astoria, Fort Vancouver, Fort Dalles, camp on slope
of Mt. Hood, and summit of Mt. Hood. Observations had been taken for
several years at Astoria for me by Louis Wilson, U. S. Tidal Observer, at 7,
<span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, 2, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, and 9, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, of every day, besides hourly observations for ten days
or more of each month. The cistern of this barometer is fifty-three feet above
mean low tide.</p>

<p>At Fort Vancouver observations of the same character were commenced
July 1st of this year, and are still going on. At Fort Dalles similar observations
have been made since July 10th.</p>

<p>The observations at the camp on the mountain slope were commenced at 7,
<span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, on August 22d, and continued hourly (with few omissions) until 8, <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, on
the twenty-fourth. The barometer at the summit was hung up at 1:30, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>,
and allowed to stand a half hour in free air, but protected from the direct rays
of the sun. It was then adjusted and observed at 2, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, 2:15, <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, and 2:30,
<span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, by Mr. Heuer and Mr. Best, independently, and the two records as shown
to me were essentially the same. The mean reading of the barometer reduced
to 32° Fahrenheit, was 19,941 inches, with an <i>observed</i> air temperature of
41°.7, and wet bulb of 31°.3. The height of Fort Vancouver above Astoria
was computed from the mean of the simultaneous observations taken during the
months of July and August. The height of the Dalles above Fort Vancouver
was deduced from the corresponding observations during twenty-one days in
July, together with those for the month of August. The height of the camp
on the mountain slope above Fort Vancouver, and also the height of that camp
above Fort Dalles, were then separately computed from the daily means of the
observations taken at the three stations during August 23d. The difference
between the two should give the same result as by the direct calculations between
Fort Vancouver and Fort Dalles; but on account of the short period observed
on the mountain camp, a plus correction of a little over eight feet was found
necessary to the estimated height of that camp to make the three results agree.</p>

<p>It then remained only to calculate the height of the summit of Mount Hood
above the mountain camp. The mean of the three observations of the barometer
was assumed as the nearest approximation we can have to the mean pressure
for that day, as the horary oscillation at the summit is unknown. With
regard to the mean temperature for that day, we have no positive data to determine
it. We cannot take the observed temperature, as the observations were
taken during the hottest part of the day.</p>

<p>By consulting the hourly observations of the thermometer at the camp, I find
the range there is between 63° and 43°.7, or nearly 20°; and supposing nearly
as great a range of temperature on the summit, I have assumed the mean temperature
then for that day to be 34°.</p>

<p>The following is the final result of the computations:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

</table>

<p>The computations are made with new tables which will shortly be published,
and which give results similar to Plantamour’s formula, based on Regnault’s
constants. They give results somewhat higher than if Guyot’s tables had been
used, the latter giving the height of the summit, 11,185 feet.</p>

<p>On our return I took a single observation at what is called “Government
Camp,” about four miles below the camp on the mountain slope, and another at
a place called Stumpville, some eight miles further on the road towards Portland.
The results give for the former place 3,864 feet, and for the latter 1,830
feet above the sea level.</p>

<p>The instruments used on the mountain have been returned in excellent order,
and compared with the one at Fort Vancouver with most satisfactory results.</p>

<p>It may be asked: Why is it that the results here given differ so widely from
some previous estimates? Mount Hood is said to be, by Mitchell’s School
Atlas, 18,361 feet, and the Rev. Geo. H. Atkinson with a party, ascended to
the summit in August of last year, boiled water with a spirit-lamp, found that
the thermometer read 180°, and therefore concludes the mountain is 17,600 feet,
and Government Camp 4,400 feet above the sea. The reason is, that the
instruments used are unreliable, and this method of computing the altitude
defective. With a boiling point apparatus (or thermo-barometer as it is called)
of the most approved kind, the results by boiling water are far inferior to those
by the cistern barometer; but if the observations are made with a common thermometer,
with small spaces for degrees, as was the case in this instance, and the
instrument not protected from drafts of air, the results are utterly unreliable,
and therefore worse than worthless.</p>

<p>Apart from the observations here described, there are other evidences to show
that the determination of the height of this mountain here given is not underestimated.
Col. B. C. Smith, one of our party who reached the summit, had
this year ascended Mount Shasta, a mountain measured by Prof. Whitney to
be 14,440 feet. The Colonel states that he feels confident, from the comparative
ease with which he ascended Mount Hood, that it is of much less altitude
than Mount Shasta.</p>

<p>On Mount Hood butterflies were found within a thousand feet of the summit.
Finally, Prof. Whitney and others, from rough triangulations, have estimated it
be about 12,000 feet.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that other parties with good instruments will take further
observations on this mountain. As the height of Fort Vancouver and Fort
Dalles are known, and as these are now permanent meteorological stations,
further observations on Mount Hood can be referred to one of these stations as
a base, and good results obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>While another set of such observations may produce slightly different results,
I think they will not differ one hundred feet from the estimate here given.</p>

from Mr. Dall, dated at “St. Michael’s, Russian America, August

following are some extracts from these letters:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have traveled on snow shoes, with the thermometer from 8° to 40° below
zero, about four hundred miles. I have paddled in open canoes up stream six
hundred and fifty miles, and down 1,300 miles. I have obtained 4,550 specimens,
including a set of the rocks from Fort Youkon to the sea, sufficient to
determine the geological formations for 1,300 miles. The only fossiliferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
beds are on the Youkon, and they extend about sixty miles. They are brown
sandstones, containing bivalve mollusca and vegetable remains. There is a
small seam of coal thirty miles below the bend, and thin shale above and below.
The coal is of good quality; but there is so little of it that it is worthless.
These are the only fossiliferous strata I have thus far found. The rocks above
and below are all azoic and nonstratified, excepting a little hard blue or black
slate. Granite, and especially mica, are very rare. I found a pebble containing
the well known fossils of the Niagara limestone on the beach near Fort
Youkon. Fossil wood and bones and teeth of <i>Elephas</i> and <i>Ovibos moschatus</i>
are common over the country. There is a broad patch of volcanic eruptive
rock on the river near the lower bend, and it extends to the sea. The islands
of St. Michael and Stuart are formed of it, and it is roughly columnar on the
former near the Fort.”</p>

<p>“I have looked carefully for glacial traces, and so far have found absolutely
none.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Dall adds that it is his intention to spend another year in
Russian America, working at his own expense, in order to finish
the explorations commenced by himself, and which the failure of
the Telegraph Company rendered it impossible for him to continue
officially.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper and Professor Whitney discussed the question
whether the volcanoes of Oregon and Washington Territory were
to be classed as active. The evidence on this point seemed very
conflicting, so far as showers of ashes are concerned. There is no
doubt, however, of the existence of solfataric action on Mount
Hood, Mount St. Helens, and probably on Rainier and Baker.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney exhibited some photographs and stereographs,
taken for the Geological Survey by Mr. W. Harris, in the Upper
Tuolumne Valley, near Soda Springs, Mount Dana, Mount Hoffmann,
and Mount Lyell. He also presented the following account
of a remarkable portion of the Tuolumne Valley, which forms
almost an exact counterpart of the Yosemite. It is by Mr. Hoffmann,
the head of a party of the Geological Survey, by which it
was explored last summer:</p>

<h3>Notes on Hetch-Hetchy Valley.</h3>

<p class="center">BY C. F. HOFFMANN.</p>

<p>Tuolumne Valley, or Hetch-Hetchy, as it is called by the Indians (the meaning
of this word I was unable to ascertain) is situated on Tuolumne River about
fifteen miles in a straight line below Tuolumne Meadows and Soda Springs, and
about twelve miles north of Yosemite Valley. Its elevation above the sea is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
from 3,800 to 3,900 feet, a little less than that of Yosemite. The valley is three
miles long running nearly east and west, with but little fall in this distance.
Near its center it is cut in two by a low spur of shelving granite coming from
the south. The lower part forms a large open meadow with excellent grass, one
mile in length, and gradually increasing from ten chains to a little over half a
mile in width, and only timbered along the edges. The lower part of this
meadow terminates in a very narrow cañon, the hills sloping down to the river
at an angle of from 40° to 60°, only leaving a channel from six to ten feet wide;
the river in the valley having an average width of about fifty feet. This is the
principal cause of the overflow in spring time of the lower part of the valley, and
probably also has given rise to the report of there being a large lake in the
valley. Below this cañon is another small meadow, with a pond. The upper
part of Hetch-Hetchy, east of the granite spur, forms a meadow one and three-fourths
miles in length, varying from ten to thirty chains in width, well timbered
and affording good grazing. The scenery resembles very much that of the Yosemite,
although the bluffs are not as high, nor do they extend as far. On the
north side of the valley, opposite the granite spur we first have a perpendicular
bluff, the top of which is 1,800 feet above the valley; the talus at the base is
about five hundred feet above the valley, leaving a precipice of about 1,300 feet.
In the spring when the snows are melting a large creek precipitates itself over
the western part of this bluff. I was told that this fall is one of the grandest
features of the valley, sending its spray all over its lower portion. It was dry,
however, at the time of my visit. The fall is 1,000 feet perpendicular, after
which it strikes the debris and loses itself among the rocks. About thirty
chains further east we come to the Hetch-Hetchy fall; its height above the
valley is 1,700 feet. This fall is not perpendicular, although it appears so from
the front, as may be seen from the photograph by Mr. Harris. It falls in a
series of cascades at an angle of about 70°. At the time of my visit the volume
of water was much greater than that of Yosemite fall, and I was told that in
the spring its roarings can be heard for miles.</p>

<p>Still further east we have two peaks, shaped very much like “The Three
Brothers,” in the Yosemite. Their base forms a large, naked and sloping granite
wall on the north side of the valley, broken by two timbered shelves, which run
horizontally the whole length of the wall. Up to the lower shelf or bend, about
eight hundred feet high, the wall, which slopes at an angle of from 45° to 70°,
is polished by glaciers, and probably these markings extend still higher up, as
on entering the valley the trail followed back of and along a moraine for several
miles, the height of which was about 1,200 feet above the valley. The same
polish shows itself in places all along the bluffs on both sides, and particularly
fine on the granite spur crossing the valley. There is no doubt that the largest
branch of the great glacier which originated near Mt. Dana and Mount Lyell,
made its way by Soda Springs to this valley. A singular feature of this valley
is the total absence of talus or debris at the base of the bluffs, excepting at one
place in front of the falls. Another remarkable rock, corresponding with
Cathedral Rock in the Yosemite, stands on the south side of the valley, directly
opposite Hetch-Hetchy fall; its height is 2,270 feet above the valley. The
photograph by Mr. Harris will give some idea of this rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>At the upper end of the valley the river forks, one branch, nearly as large as
the main river, coming from near Castle Peak, the main river itself from Soda
Springs. About half a mile up the main cañon, the river forms some cascades,
the highest being about thirty feet.</p>

<p>The valley was first visited, in 1850, by Mr. Joseph Screech, a mountaineer
of this region, who found it occupied by Indians. This gentleman informed me
that, up to a very recent date, this valley was disputed ground between the Pah
Utah Indians from the eastern slope and the Big Creek Indians from the western
slope of the Sierras; they had several fights, in which the Pah Utahs proved
victorious. The latter still visit the valley every fall to gather acorns, which
abound in this locality. Here I may also mention that the Indians speak of a
lake of very salt water on their trail from here to Castle Peak. Mr. Screech
also informed me of the existence of a fall, about a hundred feet high, on the
Tuolumne River, about four miles below this valley, and which prevents fish
from coming up any higher. The climate is said to be milder in winter than
that of the Yosemite Valley, as is also indicated by a larger number of oaks
and a great number of <i>Pinus Sabiniana</i>. The principal tree of the valley is
<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>; besides this we have <i>P. Sabiniana</i>, Cedar, <i>Q. Sonomensis</i>, <i>Q.
crassipocula</i>; also poplar and cottonwood.</p>

<p>The valley can be reached easily from Big Oak Flat by taking the regular
Yosemite trail, by Sprague’s Ranch and Big Flume, as far as Mr. Hardin’s
fence, between south and middle fork of Tuolumne River, about eighteen miles
from Big Oak Flat. Here the trail turns off to the left, going to Wade’s
Meadows or Big Meadows, sometimes called Reservoir Meadows, the distance
being about seven miles. From Wade’s Ranch the trail crosses the middle
fork of Tuolumne and goes to the Hog Ranch, five miles; thence up divide
between the middle fork and main river, about two miles, to another little ranch
called “The Cañon.” From here the trail winds down through rocks for six miles
to Tuolumne Cañon. This trail is well blazed, and was made by Mr. Screech
and others, for the purpose of driving sheep and cattle to the valley. The whole
distance from Big Oak Flat is thirty-eight miles.</p>

<p>Another trail equally good, but a little longer, leaves the Yosemite trail about
half a mile beyond the crossing of the south fork, thence crosses the middle fork
within about one and a half miles of the south fork crossing, and follows up the
divide between the middle fork and the main river, joining the first-named trail
at the Hog Ranch.</p>

<h3>On the Organs of Copulation in the Male of the Embiotocoid
Fishes.</h3>

<p class="center">BY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.</p>

<p>Some months since I presented a communication to the Academy pointing
out the manner in which the fœtus of the embiotocoid fishes was nourished
whilst it was being developed within the ovisac. (See p. 314.) I there stated
that the ingress of water into the ovisac would not take place at all freely, as
the organ communicated with the surface by a narrow canal surrounded by
muscular fibres. This structure of the oviduct would evidently oppose an
obstacle to the entrance of the semen into the ovisac for the purpose of impregnation,
unless some means exist by which the ventral surfaces of the fish can be
maintained in contact during the act of copulation, as the penis consists of a
slightly developed tubercle which cannot penetrate for any distance into the
oviduct. From the direction of the orifices of the penis and oviduct it is
evident that anything like a perfect contact of these organs can only be maintained
whilst the fishes are in a reversed position, so that the head of one fish is
towards the tail of the other. In order that contact may be maintained whilst
in this position, we find the caudal fin of the male fish furnished with certain
appendages which enable it to give a firm hold to the ventral fins of the female,
so that close contact of the ventral surfaces can be maintained. These appendages
are of two kinds. In <i>Embiotoca</i>, <i>Damolichthys</i> and some other genera,
we find a well developed mammary elevation situated near the anterior part of
the anal fin on both sides, terminating in front by a teat-like process. In
<i>Amphisticus</i>, <i>Holconotus</i> and some other genera, this mammary appendage is
wanting; but its place is supplied by a bony transverse plate with serrated
edges, inserted in the fin some distance farther back and parallel to the fin
rays. In addition to these plates there are also found cartilaginous ridges with
roughened borders, placed in front of the plates, and running parallel with the
edge of the fin. I think there can be no doubt but that these fin appendages
serve the purpose I have assigned to them, for on placing the fish in the
reversed position, with the orifice of the oviduct and penis in contact, it will be
seen that they enable the ventral fins of the female to secure a firm hold on the
anal fin of the male, so as to keep the fish in contact during the process of copulation.
At the season of copulation, the anterior surface of the anal fin in
the male becomes covered with a thick layer of firm epithelium. As this commences
at a short distance from the ventral attachment of the fin, a well marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
groove is formed at the base of the fin, which affords an additional hold for the
ventral fin of the female. After the season of copulation is over, and the testicles
regain their quiescent state, this epithelium almost disappears. At the
same time the mammary sack diminishes very much in size, so that when the
testicles are reduced to their smallest size, hardly a trace of the sack remains.
One or the other of these forms of appendages have been found on the anal fin
of the male in all the species of embiotocoid fishes I have examined.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Stearns exhibited some fossils collected by Mr. Schmidt near
Orleans Bar, Klamath County.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney exhibited some peculiar ores from Nevada
and Mexico. Those from Nevada were antimoniate of lead, containing
considerable silver. This occurs in Humboldt County, and
in sufficiently large quantities to be mined and smelted, with success
as is stated, the value of the silver being about $100 per ton. The
Mexican ore is a pure oxide of antimony, which will be more fully
described hereafter. It occurs in several mines in the northern
provinces.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney made some remarks on the mineral species
occurring in California and on the Pacific Coast of America in
general. The following is an abstract of these remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>He stated that the number of minerals occurring in California, and on the
Pacific coast in general, taking the country from Northern Mexico to British
Columbia, was quite small in proportion to the area of the region. Especially
among the silicates is there a great deficiency in species, and very few of those
which do occur are found of sufficiently well crystallized form to be valuable as
cabinet specimens.</p>

<p>The total number of species (following the fourth edition of Dana’s Mineralogy
for names, etc.) believed to exist on the Pacific coast, including Northern Mexico,
Arizona, California, Nevada and Oregon, is one hundred and ten, of which,
however, thirteen are somewhat doubtful. Of the one hundred and ten, there
are eighty-nine which occur in California. Some of the mineral species most
common in other parts of the world, and especially in mining regions, are either
entirely unknown here, or else exceedingly rare. Thus <i>barytes</i>, which is so
abundant a veinstone in England and Germany, is almost unknown in the Sierra
Nevada, having been only found in one or two localities, and there in small
quantity. Fluor is entirely wanting in the Sierra Nevada, although found in
some quantity in Arizona and Nevada. Not a trace of this elsewhere so common
mineral has been found, so far as known, in California.</p>

<p>Among the silicates most universally diffused, but which are up to this time
entirely unknown in California, the following may be mentioned as some of
the most prominent: beryl, topaz, zircon, Wollastonite, scapolite, spodumene,
Allanite, iolite, staurotide, kyanite, spinel, nepheline, datholite and all the zeolites,
in other countries so abundant where volcanic rocks occur. Not a well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
defined specimen of a zeolite has yet been found within the borders of California.</p>

<p>Another curious fact in the mineralogy of California is the occurrence of some
mineral species which are common as ores in other mining countries, and which
in California, or at least in the mining region of the Sierra Nevada, are disseminated
through a great number of localities, but nowhere exist in workable
quantity. Galena and blende may be particularly referred to as occurring in
this way. There is hardly a gold-bearing vein in the Sierra which has not some
galena and blende in fine particles in the veinstone; but not a locality is known
where the quantity of either of these ores is anything like sufficient to justify
mining, even were the other conditions as favorable as in the Eastern States or
in Europe. Galena occurs in considerable quantity in the extreme south-eastern
portion of the State, or just over the borders, in Arizona and Nevada; but no
considerable deposit of zinc blende has yet been made known anywhere in the
Pacific States or Territories; nor is any other ore of zinc known to occur in
workable quantity on this coast.</p>

<p>The mineral region with which ours most nearly agrees, in the character of its
ores and mineral substances, is that of the South American Andes, especially of
Chile. In Mr. David Forbes’ recent catalogue of the Chilean minerals, there
are about two hundred species enumerated, of which about sixty have hitherto
been discovered in California and the other Pacific States and Territories. The
Chilean mineral list, like that of California, is remarkable for the absence of
many of the almost universally distributed silicates mentioned above as wanting
in the Pacific States, namely: beryl, topaz, zircon, Wollastonite, Allanite, iolite,
staurotide, kyanite, spodumene, spinel and datholite. Many other silicates,
abundantly distributed throughout other portions of the world, might be mentioned
as entirely wanting along the whole Pacific Coast. Several of the more
common zeolites are found in the Chilean list, which are wanting in California;
while several others are equally wanting in both countries. Among the common
zeolites found in Chile which have not yet been discovered in California
are Prehnite, stilbite, Laumontite and scolecite; while analcime, harmotome,
Thomsonite, natrolite and Heulandite are wanting there as well as here.</p>

<p>It is evident, from a comparison of the mineral lists of the States situated
along the Pacific Coast of North and South America, that there has been a
most remarkable resemblance in the conditions which have influenced the formation
and segregation of the accidental minerals now found accompanying the
stratified and eruptive masses throughout the whole vast extent of the regions
in question. This is another of the facts which go to show the unity of the
Cordilleras of North and South America as a geological result.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Bolander stated that the absence of many mineral species
from this coast found its parallel in a similar absence of many
botanical groups.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper did not think there was any poverty with respect to
animal species on this coast, and suggested that the absence of certain
groups of plants might be due to the absence of certain appropriate
mineral constituents from the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Behr thought that the Californian lepidoptera more nearly
conformed to European and Mexican types than to those of the
Eastern States.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney read the following communication, supplementary
to the one presented at the previous meeting.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The subject of the relation of the accidental minerals occurring on the
Pacific coast was brought forward by me at the last meeting, and I wish now
to add a few words in regard to the elementary substances occurring in California,
an inquiry which will also afford us some interesting data for comparing
the geological and chemical conditions prevailing through the great chain of the
Cordilleras of North and South America.</p>

<p>I find on carefully tabulating the facts observed by the Geological Survey,
in regard to the mineral combinations existing on the coast, that of the sixty-four
elementary substances existing in nature, so far as yet known to chemists,
there are only thirty-six which have been proven to occur in California, in mineral
combinations.</p>

<p>Those which are wanting here are the following: bromine, glucinum, cadmium,
cæsium, cerium, didymium, erbium, fluorine, iodine, indium, lanthanum,
lithium, niobium, norium, palladium, ruthenium, rubidium, strontium, tantalum,
terbium, thallium, thorium, uranium, vanadium, bismuth, tungsten, yttrium,
zirconium (28.)</p>

<p>Of elementary substances occurring in the adjacent States, and not yet
detected in California, there are, so far as I know, only three, namely: bismuth,
fluorine and tungsten. This would make twenty-three elements wanting on the
Pacific Coast of North America. Of these a few are extremely rare, in general,
and would hardly be expected to occur here. Among these are didymium,
erbium, indium, lanthanum, norium, thorium. But there are others, the
absence of which is indeed quite surprising. Fluorine, for instance, is an element
of extremely wide distribution, and one which occurs in great quantity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
most mineral countries. Here it will probably hereafter be detected in our
micas, and perhaps in other combinations, and also in mineral and sea water;
but its most abundant source, fluor-spar, seems entirely wanting in this State.</p>

<p>Bismuth is another element of common occurrence in various combinations,
but it has not yet been detected in California. A few minute scales of a mineral
that I determined to be bismuth-silver, from the Twin Ophir mine, Nevada,
is the only authentic instance I know of thus far, of the occurrence of this element
on the Pacific coast. Tungsten, uranium and vanadium, are tolerably
widely disseminated; the latter, however, less so than the former. No trace of
either has yet been found on this coast north of Mexico; of strontium, zirconium,
and glucinum, the same may be said. If we now compare the distribution of the
elements in the South American Andes with that on this coast, we shall find
some striking points of resemblance; and to a large extent, either the absence,
or else the great rarity of several of the elementary substances not seen in
other mineral regions, is a fact which holds good along the whole extent of the
American Continent on the Pacific side. Fluorine, in combination with calcium,
is almost as rare in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, as on this coast. Indeed,
it was formerly supposed by Domeyko not to occur at all in Chile, but
recently one or two localities, where it is found in small quantity, have been
made known. Tungsten occurs in Peru at one locality in the form of wolfram,
and in Chile in one or two localities, also in Lower California, but its combinations
are extremely rare along the whole coast. The same may be said of
uranium. Strontium and zirconium have not yet been discovered in Chile or
Peru, although the former occurs in one locality in New Grenada, and glucinum
has only recently been found in Chile in very minute quantity in one locality.
No combination of lithium is yet known on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>Among the leading facts connected with the occurrence of mineral substances
and the elementary bodies on the Pacific coast, and especially in the Cordilleras
of North and South America, the following may be mentioned as generally
applicable to the whole of the vast region extending from British Columbia to
Chile:</p>

<p>1st. The paucity of species considering the extent of the region as compared
with other parts of the world, and especially with other mineral regions.</p>

<p>2d. The remarkable absence of the prominent silicates, and especially of the
zeolites.</p>

<p>3d. The absence of a large number of the elementary substances, and the
paucity of several others of very common occurrence in other mineral regions.</p>

<p>4th. The very wide spread and abundant occurrence of the precious metals,
gold and silver, and the not uncommon occurrence of platina.</p>

<p>5th. The great abundance of ores of copper, and the comparative absence of
tin, lead, and zinc.</p>

<p>6th. The similarity in the mineralized condition of the silver—antimony and
chlorine being prominent mineralizers of this metal—while in Chile the rarer
combinations of iodine, bromine, and selenium occur, these latter being as yet
unknown north of Mexico.</p>

<p>7th. The absence or paucity as veinstone, or gangue, of one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
prominent minerals occurring as such in other mineral regions, namely, fluor;
to which it may be added, that both calcite and barytes are extremely rare as
veinstones in California, and to judge from all the Mexican and Chilean collections
that I have seen, well crystallized specimens are very rare in those
countries.</p>

<p>8th. There is no elementary substance, and but few mineral species peculiar
to the Pacific coast, so far as yet ascertained.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney remarked on the depression of Death Valley,
the sink of the Amargosa River, below the level of the sea. Recently
it has been repeatedly stated in the newspapers that no such
depression really existed, and that, in point of fact, the valley in
question was several thousand feet above the sea level, Mr. Gabb
being cited as authority.</p>

<p>The valley visited by Mr. Gabb, however, was not, it appears, the
real Death Valley, but one to which that name was given by an
explorer by mistake. The true Death Valley is the sink of the
Amargosa, while the one visited by Mr. Gabb is near the head of
that river. The barometrical observations on which the statement
of the depression of the real Death Valley is based were taken, in
1861, by a party of the California Boundary Survey. The observations
were made with a barometer, which was compared before and
after being used, with a standard, by Colonel R. S. Williamson,
by whom also the computations and reductions of the observations
were made; there was also a station barometer at the time on the
Colorado, at no great distance, and this instrument was in good
order. Thus it will be seen that the conditions were, in most
respects, exceptionably favorable for a correct measure of the altitude
of the valley, and it may be safely assumed that its depression
below the sea level is not far from one hundred and seventy-five feet,
as stated on Colonel Williamson’s authority, in the Geology of California,
Vol. I. To secure a more reliable result, it would be necessary
to have a long series of observations taken there with a well-adjusted
instrument, and it would be desirable also to have a station
barometer on the Colorado, or at some other not too distant point.
It will probably be a long time before these favorable conditions are
secured; and, in the meantime, Col. Williamson’s result must be
received as a close approximation to the actual amount of the
depression of this very remarkable locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bolander, referring to a previous enumeration of pine species
in California, submitted by him, stated that he must now reduce the
number of true species by one, leaving the total at only fifteen.
He also remarked upon the species of fir in this State, enumerating
four only as being strongly marked. He showed the leaves and
seeds of two species, and commented upon the mistake of Murray in
asserting that there is a fifth species, which he calls <i>Picea magnifica</i>,
but which is really <i>Picea amabilis</i>. Mr. Bolander thought the
tendency to multiply species erroneously was attributable to a desire
to make a market for seeds, those of new species being always
in demand at good prices.</p>

<h3>Note on three new Localities of Tellurium Minerals in California,
and on some Mineralogical Features of the Mother
Vein.</h3>

<p class="center">BY B. SILLIMAN.</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <span class="smcap">Tellurium Minerals.</span>—It is well known to mineralogists and others
that in the Melones Mine, on Carson Hill, there occurs, in considerable abundance,
a tellurium compound which has been called Sylvanite by some mineralogists,
but apparently without sufficient authority. It occurs in one of the veins
on the Melones property, associated with Dolomite and quartz, in what appears
to be a gneissic rock; but the mine being under water I am dependent on the
specimens kindly furnished me by the intelligent proprietor, Mr. <span class="smcap">G. K. Stevenot</span>,
for my knowledge of the gangue.</p>

<p>At the “Golden Rule” Mine, on the mother lode near Poverty Hill, in Tuolumne
County, I detected in August last the same tellurium minerals which are
found at Carson Hill in the Melones. The veinstone here is an argillite, with
thread-like veins of quartz crossing the cleavages of the slate, and in these <i>filons</i>
of quartz gold is seen in beautiful specimens. It was in this association that I
detected two or three small groups of brilliant crystalline plates, identical in
appearance and physical characters with the Melones mineral, which has been
called Sylvanite, and affording the same blowpipe reactions.</p>

<p>At the Rawhide Rancho, a mine near Jamestown, on the mother lode, of
which I have had occasion to make a careful study, there occurs a deposit or
shoot of very rich sulphides containing copper, antimony, iron, arsenic, with gold,
silver and tellurium. This ore has in general a bronzy, blackish appearance;
shows often free gold in scales of a blackish yellow color, and appears to be a
kind of fahlerz, or gray-copper ore, the value of which in silver and gold rises to
one thousand dollars per ton, (2,000 lbs.) or even higher. Associated with this
ore are brilliant sectile, flexible scales of the same tellurium compound which
occurs at Stanislaus and Golden Rule, but in the Rawhide Mine intimately
blended with the blackish sulphides before-named—occasionally in nests or small
bunches with metallic gold. The blowpipe readily detects in this ore antimony,
arsenic, tellurium, copper, iron, manganese, lime, magnesia, chromium, aluminum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
gold and silver. It is only in portions containing dolomite and the peculiar
greenish mineral, so characteristic of the mother lode, that lime, magnesia,
alumina, and chromium are detected. In portions of the fahlerz-like mineral
which appear nearly pure, the blowpipe detects only antimony, arsenic, copper,
iron, and manganese.</p>

<p>Having transmitted characteristic specimens of these ores, with other interesting
California species, to Professors Dana and Brush, at New Haven, these
mineralogists inform me, by letter just received, that the tellurids above-named
appear to be referable to a new species hitherto undescribed, and Prof. Brush
proposes to undertake an analysis of it upon the specimens transmitted by me,
which are barely sufficient for the purpose. It is a tellurid of silver and gold,
containing more silver than gold. Associated with it is a white cleavable
mineral which Prof. Brush thinks may prove to be native tellurium; this is in
the Melones and Golden Rule specimens.</p>

<p><i>Hessite.</i> I obtained from the Reist Mine, on the northeasterly end of Whisky
Hill, Tuolumne County, a very small crystal corresponding in its physical characters
to the extremely rare telluric silver, known to mineralogists as <i>Hessite</i>.
It occurs in the auriferous slates to the east of the main vein; the slates being
opened here for a width of seventy-five feet as an open cut. My attention was
called to the existence of this species at the Reist Mine by Mr. D. T. Hughes,
of Tuolumne County, who informed me that there was an interesting mineral
species there containing, as he believed, tellurium, and that masses of it, half an
ounce in weight, had been obtained some years since. Unfortunately these
specimens fell into ignorant hands, and were destroyed in idle attempts to determine
the nature of the substance. On visiting the locality, which is within one
mile of the Rawhide Rancho, and on the opposite side of Table Mountain, I
found that the proprietor was exploring in a different part of the open cut from
that where this species was found, the place being under water. Fortunately in
a collection of minerals from Whisky Hill, formed by Mr. Williams, one of the
proprietors, and preserved in his house there, I was able to detect one small
mass of the Hessite which Mr. Williams divided with me. This Mr. Hughes
recognized as identical with the larger masses he had obtained at this mine some
years since.</p>

<p>Prof. Bush, in his letter to Prof. Silliman, of October 29th, recognizes this
species as Hessite. The specimen was associated with native gold which had
been amalgamated and heated, but the constitution of the Hessite did not seem
to be affected thereby.</p>

<p>“<i>Tellurid of Silver</i>” is mentioned by Blake, in his list of California species, as
found by him near Georgetown, in El Dorado County, in 1854, washed from the
gold drift, but the parent vein had never been found.—Ross Browne’s Report,
1867, p. 209.</p>

<p>It appears therefore, from the present state of our knowledge, that a compound
of gold and silver tellurium belonging probably to a new species has been
detected in three localities upon the mother vein, and associated with it in two
of these, probably also native tellurium; and that Hessite (the tellurid of silver)
has been found in place in one locality and in the drift in another. I have also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
detected the foliated tellurium in extremely minute quantity in one of the mines
at Angels, and I mentioned in a publication, in 1864, its probable occurrence
among the ores of the Josephine and Pine Tree Mines of Mariposa. A careful
scrutiny will probably detect those compounds of tellurium at other points when
the mother vein is opened, as at Blue Gulch, Quartz Mountain, and Whisky Hill.
I have already recognized the blackish antimonial copper sulphides at the App
Mine and Silver’s Mine, and in the croppings on the surface of Whisky Hill.
Indeed it may not be too much to state that these ores appear to be somewhat
characteristic of those portions of the mother vein occurring south of Angels,
and especially wherever it is inclosed in magnesian rocks.</p>

<p>Genth has named a species <i>Melonite</i>, from Melones Mine, which he says is a
tellurid of nickel. I have not been able to recognize this compound among
those ores of the Melones, which I have seen.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) <span class="smcap">Some Mineralogical Features of the Mother Vein.</span>—From the
opportunity I have had of studying the mother vein, I arrive at the general
conclusion that its mineralogical characteristics vary greatly with the chemical
constitution of the rocks which inclose it. Wherever the serpentine or talcose
and calcareous rocks from the inclosing walls, or are near it, the mineral contents
of the vein are essentially different from those observed where the inclosing
rocks are argillites, or syenites and diorites.</p>

<p>These we find at Mariposa, in the Josephine and Pine Tree Mines, at Peñon
Blanco, Maxwell Creek, Blue Gulch, Quartz Mountain, Silver’s, Whisky Hill,
Rawhide, Chapavele Hill, Carson Hill, Angels, and Placerville—at all which
places I have examined the mother lode with more or less care—a peculiar light
apple-green mineral, occurring in scales, associated with iron pyrites in small
and brilliant pentagonal dodecahedrons and implanted in a gangue of dolomite
mingled with quartz. The dolomite is of the variety known as ankerite,
and by its decomposition, which seems hastened by the oxidation of the associated
pyrites, gives origin to those highly characteristic masses of brown and
reddish-yellow iron gossan which form the characteristic feature of the outcroppings
of those portions of the mother vein just enumerated. These gossans
always retain the bright green mineral before alluded to unchanged, as
also cellular quartz which discloses in its rhombic cavities the form of the
decomposed crystals of dolomite or ankerite whose removal has left the vacant
spaces. Before decomposition this triple carbonate of lime, magnesia, and iron
is brilliantly white, and its real chemical character would never be suspected.</p>

<p>The green mineral, so far as I can ascertain, has never been described,
although it has often been noticed. It has been called by some, <i>nickel gymnite</i>,
and I have once distinguished it by this name in a mining report. But this is
a misnomer which I take this occasion to correct; nickel gymnite of Genth,
found at Texas, Penna., is a hydrous silicate of magnesia, lime, and nickel. The
species so characteristic of certain portions of the mother vein is anhydrous,
and contains no nickel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mariposite</span> (Provisional Name). Before the blowpipe it yields evidence of
the presence of the protoxides of iron, lime, magnesia, and potassium; of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
sesquioxides of chromium and aluminum with carbonic, silicic, and sulphuric
acids. The oxide of manganese and sulphuric acid exist only as traces. The
mineral is probably new, and must be referred to the mica section of an hydrous
silicate. Should it, on a careful chemical examination, prove to be new, I
would suggest the name <i>Mariposite</i> as an appropriate name for it, as it was on
the Mariposa estate that it first attracted my attention, and where it exists
in great abundance.</p>

<p>This species which is so characteristic of the mother vein, in connection with
magnesian or chloritic rocks, occurs nowhere so far as I have observed in this
vein when it is inclosed in argillites or syenites.</p>

<p>Of sulphides occurring in the mother lode there are two classes which deserve
special mention, beside the ordinarily occurring pyrites of iron and copper.</p>

<p>These are the (1) antimonial copper sulphides, and the (2) antimonial lead
sulphides; both are arsenical and are rich in both gold and silver.</p>

<p>To the first class allusion has already been made in the former part of this
paper. Besides the Rawhide Mine, they are found in most of the openings on
Whisky Hill, in Tuolumne County, in the Silver, App and Josephine, and Pine
Tree Mines. The lively stains of blue malachite, seen at Williams’ Mine, on
Whisky Hill, and occasionally elsewhere, are derived from atmospheric decomposition
of the antimonial copper sulphides. The blowpipe detects the presence
of iron, antimony, arsenic, copper, sulphur, tellurium (in certain cases) sulphur,
gold and silver. The vein is so abundant as to give to the raw ore, in some
cases, magnetic properties; and the button from the blowpipe assay becomes
strongly magnetic.</p>

<p>The antimonial lead sulphides occur in considerable abundance at the Trio
Claims, on Whisky Hill. The appearance of this ore recalls that of granular
galena. The gold and silver value of this ore is very high, but no portion of it
can be saved by the ordinary mechanical treatment with mercury. The blowpipe
detects the presence of antimony, lead, iron, arsenic, sulphur, gold and
silver. There is no trace of copper, and the quantity of arsenic present is
slight. The ore is therefore essentially an antimonial lead sulphide, rich in gold
and silver.</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe, that as this remarkable vein becomes more
thoroughly explored, it will disclose other new or rare compounds containing
gold, and that these already noticed will be found to be more widely diffused
when proper care is applied to the study of the mineralogy of the lode.</p>

<p>In Amador County the mother lode is found in connection with argillaceous
slates and syenite. Thus at the Eureka Mine, of Hayward, known as the
Amador Mining Co., the vein has a soft, black slate for its foot wall and a
heavy, firm syenite or greenstone (called <i>granite</i> by the miners) for the hanging
wall. The mineralogy of the vein is extremely simple, being in fact nothing
more than iron and copper sulphurets, chiefly the former, with rarely galena or
blende. I sought in vain for any of the species mentioned in the former part of
this paper. There are no magnesian minerals, and the <i>Mariposite</i> is entirely
absent. The other mines of that range, as far as I examined them, all partake
of the same simplicity in mineralogical character. There can be but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
doubt, as it appears to me, that the inclosing rocks in each case exercise an
important influence on the mineral contents of the vein.</p>

<h3>List of Shells collected at Bodega Bay, California, June, 1867.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ROBERT E. C. STEARNS.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the idea mentioned in my paper on the shells of Baulines Bay,
of examining the bays and coast to the north of San Francisco, I made a brief trip
to Bodega Bay in company with my friend Dr. Newcomb, on the thirteenth of
June, 1867. Most of the species enumerated were collected within a very limited
area, between tide marks, at the extreme point of Bodega Head, as the arm of
land is called, which extending in a southerly direction from the general line of the
coast, incloses what is known as Bodega Bay. The bay itself is, for the greater part,
left bare at low tide, and the flats then exposed, composed of sandy mud, contain
abundance of the common bivalves of the coast, principally <i>Macoma</i>, (two species)
and <i>Tapes</i>, in all its varieties: <i>Saxidomus gracilis</i> may also be found here in considerable
quantities, and is at certain seasons dug by the Indians, together with the
other so called “clams.” At the spot where the principal portion of this collection
was made, the outcropping rock is a coarse granite, upon which <i>Litorina planaxis</i>
is found in great numbers. The limited time at my disposal, at the season when the
trip was made, was only sufficient to admit of a brief, and therefore unsatisfactory
reconnoissance; nevertheless, at least seventeen species were detected which have not
heretofore been found (or reported) so far to the north. Many of these species I
failed to find at Baulines, and some of them have not been reported north of
the Bay of Monterey. At Baulines, the rocks are principally shales, and contain
many species of pholads, which as will be seen by a glance at this list, if not
entirely absent, must be rare at Bodega; the various “nestlers” which are found
associated with the borers are also wanting; <i>Haliotis rufescens</i> is abundant upon
the rocky islets off the coast, but not even a fragment of <i>H. Cracherodii</i> was met
with.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolander presented a paper by Mr. Lesquereux, entitled
“A Catalogue of the species of Mosses found up to the present time
on the Northwest coast of the United States of America, and especially
in California,” which was referred to the Publication Committee
and ordered printed in the Memoirs of the Academy.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney exhibited several of the maps in preparation
at the office of the State Geological Survey, and gave a somewhat
detailed account of the operation of the survey during the year
1866 and 1867, and of the progress in the publication department
of that work. The statement made was in the main identical with

<p>Mr. R. L. Harris mentioned the fact that the railroad surveys
conducted by himself, for connecting Vallejo and Sacramento, indicated
that the latter place was not so much above the sea level as
had generally been assumed from barometrical observations, and
he believed that the top of the present levee at Sacramento was
about twenty-one feet above mean high tide at Vallejo, instead of
fifty-six, as previously supposed. If this was true, then the lowlands
in the vicinity of Sacramento were in fact, only about one
and a half feet above the sea level. The surveys of the coming
season would probably enable him to fix this important point with
accuracy.</p>

<p>Dr. Gibbons suggested that if the Tule lands in the Sacramento

processes of growth and decay, instead of being annually burned
over, the land in question might in time become sufficiently elevated
to be inhabited.</p>

<h3>Salt Spring Valley and the adjacent region in Calaveras
County.</h3>

<p class="center">BY W. A. GOODYEAR.</p>

<p>Having spent some time during the past summer in Copperopolis, and the
region lying west and northwest from it, I offer the following observations
respecting its topography and geology. I will first notice the</p>

<h4>TOPOGRAPHY.</h4>

<p>For a general description of the topography, etc., of Calaveras County,
including the main features of the region in question, reference may be made to
Prof. J. D. Whitney’s Report upon the Geology of California, Vol. I, p. 253.
In addition, however, to what is there stated, I will say that Copperopolis lies
at the <i>southwestern</i> base of Bear Mountain, the summits of which rise to an
altitude of something more than 2,000 feet above the sea. The Gopher Hills,
also mentioned in the report, form a well defined and connected, though subordinate
range, lying to the southwest of, and nearly parallel with the general
course of Bear Mountain. This range forms a prominent feature in the topography
of the region for a distance of at least fifteen or eighteen miles southeasterly
from the Calaveras river. Its summits are probably 1,400 feet above the
sea, and the lowest break or gap within the distance named is that through
which Rock Creek finds its way to the plains below. The valley or depression
between the Gopher Hills and Bear Mountain, whose average width is four to
six miles, has received the name of Salt Spring Valley. Its general altitude
is little less than 1,000 feet above the sea, that of the town of Copperopolis
being nine hundred feet according to H. P. Handy’s survey of a railroad route
from Copperopolis to Stockton. I should mention that for several miles northwesterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
from Copperopolis, Bear Mountain has an outlier along its southwestern
base, in the form of a low but tolerably well marked hilly ridge, between
which and the base of the mountain is a narrow but continuous valley; and it is in
this valley that the copper-bearing belt of Copperopolis is found. Southwest of
this outlier, and for a distance of three or four miles northwesterly from Copperopolis,
Salt Spring Valley consists mainly of a region of low hills, traversed
by a net-work of steep and narrow gulches. Farther northwest the surface of
the valley for three or four miles is more uniform, and here we find the nearly
level area of “Tower’s Ranch,” and the gently sloping basin of the “Salt
Spring Valley reservoir.” Beyond this, the country is again hilly to the Calaveras
river. Southeast and south of Copperopolis, the surface is everywhere
hilly. The slope of the Gopher Hills towards the southwest is rapid until we
reach the low rolling country which forms the border of the San Joaquin Valley.</p>

<p>Black Creek debouches from Bear Mountain a mile or so southeast of Copperopolis,
and flows to the Stanislaus. Littlejohn’s Creek takes its rise in the
hilly regions of the valley west of Copperopolis, and flowing southwesterly,
finds its way through the hills into Rock Creek. The latter rises in Bear
Mountain, five or six miles northwesterly from Copperopolis, and flowing southwest
across Salt Spring Valley, breaks through the Gopher Hills, and continues
its course through the lower country to French Camp Slough, a branch of
the San Joaquin. All these creeks become dry in the summer, though in winter
they often carry very large volumes of water. At the point where Rock
Creek breaks through the Gopher Hills is the substantial dam of the Salt
Spring Valley Reservoir.</p>

<h4>GEOLOGY.</h4>

<p>The strike and dip of the rocks are more or less variable; but, so far as my
observations extend in the region described, they have everywhere the same
general northwesterly trend and high northeasterly dip which characterize so
large a portion of the gold-bearing slates of central California. The strike is
usually from N. 50° W. to N. 70° W., (magnetic) and the dip from 50°
northeast to vertical. I have seen no case here of a decided southwesterly dip,
nor of a low one to the northeast. It is somewhat remarkable, by the way, that
this high northeasterly dip should be so general as it is in the great mass of
auriferous slates which forms the southwestern flank of the Sierra Nevada. It
is <i>towards</i> the granite axis of the chain, instead of <i>from</i> it, as would seem more
natural. The causes of this are by no means as yet fully explained. It is a
circumstance, however, which would lose none of its interest in the future, if,
as certain facts mentioned in the Geological Report, Vol. I, p. 286, might possibly
seem to indicate, further explorations should prove it to be in general a
great inversion of the strata—their upper portions having been “forced back
by immense pressure from above, producing a condition of things similar to
that so often observed in the Alps, which is known as the ‘fan structure,’ and
has so much perplexed geologists.” When we take into account the enormous
denudation, amounting to thousands of feet in perpendicular depth, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
known to have taken place in the Sierras within the most recent geological
periods, and the whole of which, in this case, must also have belonged to the
inverted portion of the strata—unless indeed the inversion were produced by a
peculiar sliding and bending of the strata by their own weight, the upper flexure
having been since entirely removed—and when, in addition to this we consider
the hundreds of miles in length, and the great thickness of the strata in
question, we can perhaps begin to appreciate the magnitude of the movements
and forces which would be involved in producing such an effect. It would
indeed, if true, be a striking illustration of the grandeur of the scale upon which
many of the physical features of this country have been cast, as compared with
those of other and better known regions. But it is hardly worth while to
speculate further upon probabilities like this in the present state of our knowledge,
and I return to my subject.</p>

<p>In Salt Spring Valley, the rocks consist almost entirely of slates, with little variety
of character, generally thin-bedded, fine-grained and argillaceous, sometimes
magnesian or chloritic, and often splitting with facility into very thin sheets.
The thinnest bedded varieties are usually fragile, and the structure is often wavy;
but sometimes the cleavage is regular and thin enough, and the rock possesses
sufficient strength to furnish a tolerable material for roofing purposes; although
no attempts have been made, so far as I know, to thus apply it;—and, in fact,
the expense attendant upon its excavation and transportation would preclude
any extensive use of it, even if its quality were unsurpassed, which it is not.</p>

<p>The earthy covering of the rocks throughout the valley is usually very shallow
and the soil poor, (Tower’s ranch is, however, an exception) and in many
places the thin sharp edges of the slates project in such a way as to form an
exceedingly jagged surface, though the projections are low, generally not exceeding
two or three feet in height. Much of the surface is strewn with float quartz,
usually in the shape of small but partially rounded pebbles. Quartz veins of
small or moderate size, parallel with the stratification, are not uncommon.
Iron pyrites is of frequent occurrence, with a little gold in the quartz. Some
of the veins have been more or less worked, but none of them to any great extent.
About three or four miles westerly from Copperopolis, in the hilly portion of
the valley, is a ten-stamp quartz mill, and a short distance from this, on Littlejohn’s
Creek, is the site of an older one, which was burned down. Neither of
these mills ever yielded much profit, so far as I can learn, nor does the present
one seem likely to do so.</p>

<p>Several of the gulches in this vicinity are said to have yielded gold enough in
the past to pay for working, although the diggings were not rich or extensive.
It is stated also that some years since, in one of these gulches, a quartz boulder
was found, weighing about one hundred pounds, which yielded between two
and three thousand dollars’ worth of gold. There are three or four quartz
veins near here, from which more or less rock has been crushed. Portions of
the rock from one of these veins, the Winnemucca, a prettily-shaped vein of
three to four feet in thickness, are very cellular in structure, and some of it
shows fine gold quite freely to the naked eye. The metal however, must be
very irregular in its distribution, or the ore would have paid better in the mill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
than the three or four dollars per ton which I am told it yielded; and in fact,
the general character of the float quartz of the region, when taken in connection
with the probable origin of the valley itself, and the fact that no important
placer “diggings” have been found here, does not seem to favor the probability
that these quartz veins will ever prove of much value. Between the present
mill and the site of the old one, as well as certain other localities in the valley,
are springs containing various alkaline salts, from which the name “Salt
Spring Valley” is derived.</p>

<p>Accompanying the copper formation of Copperopolis, and just west of it, is
an immense body of serpentine, lying parallel with the general stratification of
the slates, and traceable for miles along the valley by the openings made in it
in the workings for copper. Opposite a point 1,000 or 1,200 feet northwest of
the upper shaft of the Keystone claim, but on the southwest flank of the outlier
of Bear Mountain, already noticed, is another heavy mass of serpentine.
How far this extends in a northwest and a southeast direction I do not know,
as I have not followed its line of outcrop, but it is certainly not less than 1,000
feet in length.</p>

<p>The lithological character of the Gopher Hills is entirely different from that
of Salt Spring Valley. They consist mainly of a pretty hard and tough, more
or less coarsely crystalline, and dark-colored hornblendic or pyroxenic rock,
which is evidently metamorphic, probably of a grit or sandstone. Epidote is
not uncommon in this rock, and calcite is occasionally found, though rare.
Through most of this region the original stratification has been largely obscured,
or nearly obliterated. Its general course, however, can still be traced
without difficulty in the more or less elongated and flattened form, and the general
trend which the rocky outcrops frequently assume when viewed from a little
distance.</p>

<p>The texture of the rock varies considerably. In general it is rather coarsely
crystalline; but not unfrequently it is much finer, or even compact; sometimes
it is jointed. At one locality, in particular, (“Goodwin’s,” or “Sheep Ranch”
Gulch) I noticed this jointed structure so well developed that a compact and
very tough, almost imperishable rock could be quarried with facility, if desired,
in nearly rectangular blocks and slabs.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to find among these hills those peculiar holes in the rock
which were hollowed out and used by the Indians as mortars in which to grind
their food. I observed a number of similar holes in the hard rock, precisely in
the bed of Rock Creek, in the ravine a short distance below the dam of the Salt
Spring Valley Reservoir. It may be a question here, whether they owe their
origin to the Indians or to the action of the stream, though from the peculiar
deep and narrow form, I am inclined to ascribe them to the former. Heavy
masses of flinty rock or hornstone also occur, particularly upon the southwest
flanks of the range. This rock usually exhibits a much more distinct bedding
than the ordinary mass of the hills. Its stratification is often perfectly regular,
and sometimes the layers are beautifully thin and delicate. There is a very
heavy outcrop of this finely banded rock in the ravine a short distance below
the dam at Rock Creek. Higher up the hill, upon the road known as “Black’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
Grade,” another outcrop of the same formation has been cut across in building
the road, and here a portion of the same flinty rock is thickly filled with <i>fossils</i>,
which appear to belong either to some species of crinoids or fucoids, though the
structure is too much obliterated, and the specimens too much distorted to admit
of definite recognition. They are apparently flattened in a direction parallel
with the banding of the rock. From the general mode of occurrence of this
hornstone, and from the frequent sharp and distinct lines of demarcation between
it and the adjacent hornblendic rock, it might be inferred that the former traversed
the latter as veins, and the delicate banding of the rock, although parallel
to the general stratification of the country, would not preclude such an assumption.
But the fossils speak decidedly against it, and it is probable that the
hornstone is a metamorphic form of fine sedimentary deposits, and that the banding
is the result of the original stratification. Quartz veins occur here occasionally,
and some of them at least are auriferous, though I know of none having
been worked with profit hitherto. It is not improbable, however, that some of
them may be found remunerative in the future, since many of the gulches among
the hills here, in the early days of mining, were rich in placer gold. The degree
of metamorphism throughout these hills has been very high; but I have seen
no evidence of any direct igneous action—at least no rock that I could identify
as eruptive, with the single exception, perhaps, of a small and apparently completely
isolated body of well characterized <i>granite</i>, which occurs near the base
of the Gopher Range, and between its highly metamorphosed rocks and the San
Joaquin Valley, which is overlaid with tertiary and other recent formations.
The occurrence of this patch of granite here, isolated as it seems from any other
similar rock, is certainly a point of much interest; but I have not been able to
study its relations. Its stratigraphical and topographical position is similar to
that of the Folsom granite, and it may be connected with it in origin. If it
should hereafter appear that there is a well characterized, though more or
less interrupted line of granitic outcrops traceable throughout central California,
along the lower foothills of the mountains, and <i>west</i> of the great belt of auriferous
slates, it would have a most important bearing upon the theory of the general
structure of the Sierra Nevada. The existence of such a line, indeed, might
point to a very different, and perhaps more probable, <i>modus operandi</i> than that
already suggested, by which the auriferous slates themselves may have reached
their present position, and received their easterly dip.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting points connected with the geology of the Gopher
Hills, is the auriferous belt in which occurs the “Quail Hill” Mine, and of
which I shall speak further presently.</p>

<p>Of the geology of Bear Mountain I know but little, having crossed it by but
a single route. Where I have seen it, however, it consists largely of a similar
rock to that which forms the mass of the Gopher Hills. Chromic iron is said
to occur in considerable quantity at a certain locality in Bear Mountain, the
exact whereabouts of which I could not learn. The slates of the valley extend,
in general, completely up to the base of the Gopher and Bear Mountain ranges
on either side, and sometimes a short distance up their flanks; but here the
transition to the harder crystalline rock is usually quick and well marked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>Salt Spring Valley probably owes its existence, as such, entirely to inequality
of denudation; the comparatively friable slates yielding much more readily to mechanical
action than the harder and more highly metamorphosed rock on either
side, which has thus been left in the form of mountain ridges, projecting many
hundreds of feet above the adjacent region, while the intervening and surrounding
rock has been swept away to the plains below.</p>

<p>A partial description of the copper mines of Copperopolis will be found in
the “Geology of California,” Vol. I, pp. 254-257. The depth of the main shaft
in the “Union” is now stated to be a little over five hundred feet, and the
greatest depth reached in the “Keystone,” is said to be five hundred and sixty
feet. All the deposits of ore here worked lie parallel with the strike and dip of
the inclosing strata. The great ore mass of the “Union” Mine forks or divides
into two branches towards the northwest; and at the lowest depth now reached,
its width or thickness, after having reached a maximum, is again diminishing.
In the “Keystone” Mine there have been two separate and nearly parallel bodies
of ore worked to a considerable extent, and a third one was struck last spring
previous to the suspension of work in the mine. The two main bodies of ore
in this mine have “pinched out” or disappeared in various directions in their
lines of strike and dip. They seem to have an irregular lenticular form, and
together with the great mass of the “Union” appear to lie in what are called
“shoots,” which pitch at an angle of 50° or 60° in the direction of the strike
towards the northwest. The northwesterly prolongation of the strike of the
great “Union” deposit does not coincide with either of the “Keystone” deposits,
but passes east of them. There have been other and smaller deposits in
the “Union” ground, more or less worked, lying west of the main body, some
of which may possibly connect with the “Keystone” shoots, though the best
information I could obtain leads me to think otherwise, and that they were
probably isolated lenticular masses. The mass of the great deposit in the
“Union” Mine consists of an intimate mixture of chalcopyrite and iron pyrites,
containing on an average sixteen to seventeen per cent. of copper. Well defined
selvages are not to be seen at Copperopolis, and the country rock is impregnated
in all directions, sometimes to a considerable distance from the purer ore, with
more or less finely disseminated copper and iron pyrites. In Europe it would
pay to crush and work much of the wall rock itself for the copper which it contains;
but here it is entirely worthless, as even ten to twelve per cent. ore is
not worth mining and shipping at present prices.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the more recent and deeper developements in the Copperopolis
mines have only served to confirm the opinion expressed two years ago by
the State Geologist (Geol. Vol. I, p. 225) that “the deposits of copper ore in this
region, like nearly all the others in California, do not appear to be included in
regular fissure veins, but rather to form <i>independent masses</i> [the italics are mine]
lying in the direction of the strike of the inclosing rocks, and dipping with them.”
It seems, further, that they are here arranged in some sort <i>en échelon</i>. There
is no evidence whatever of the existence here of a regular and continuous vein of
copper ore, stretching for miles through the country, as some have supposed.
(See Ross Browne’s Report, p. 144.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>The finding of “copper indications,” <i>i.e.</i>, of small and isolated bodies of ore,
distributed with some constancy through a narrow belt of country, for no matter
how many miles in length, is anything but conclusive evidence of the existence
beneath of a <i>regular vein</i> of corresponding length (which, by the way, if
it existed, would be an anomaly in the mining world)—especially when all the
developments of the most extensive workings hitherto made point so decidedly
and strongly to the opinion that there is no <i>true vein</i> at all. Such “indications”
are however evidences, so far as they go (and they go a good way in this
direction) of the probable existence of other large bodies of ore distributed
here and there along the belt in question. It is not improbable that such may
be found in the future, and it would not be strange even if some of them should
surpass in magnitude and value the great deposit of the “Union,” which has
already yielded such enormous quantities of copper, and is yet far from being
worked out.</p>

<p>A description of the auriferous deposit of Quail Hill, in the Gopher Range,
together with a similar one at Whisky Hill (called also the “Harpending
Mine”) in Placer County, by Prof. B. Silliman, was read before the California
Academy of Natural Sciences, at their meeting of April 15th, 1867, and will
be found in their published “Proceedings,” Vol. III, pp. 349-351. This paper
describes well the particular deposits in question, as well as the general appearance
and character of the formation in which they occur. Such deposits, however,
are not confined to one or two localities; but there are other points in
Calaveras County at which gold is known to exist in considerable quantity, and
with similar mode of occurrence. Among these I may mention Quail Hill No.
2, near the Napoleon Copper Mine, two or three miles southeast of Quail Hill
No. 1, and the “Plymouth Rock,” or “Austin and Hathaway” claim, at Rich
Gulch, near the Calaveras River. Moreover, the geological causes and the
peculiar chemical decomposition of the rock, which have been involved in the
formation of the deposits in question, are by no means confined to the localities
where gold is known to occur. On the contrary, they may be traced with considerable
constancy through a narrow belt of country along the southwest flank
of the Gopher Hills, and stretching from the Calaveras River southeast for a
distance of at least fifteen miles, and perhaps farther. Towards the northwest,
the same belt crosses the Calaveras; but how much farther it extends in this
direction I have no present means of knowing. It is not unlikely that a similar
formation may be found to exist, here and there at least, in the same general
line of strike, nearly parallel with the stratification of the country, through
Amador and El Dorado Counties to Placer, and perhaps beyond. The possibility
of this at least is worth remembering. Throughout this belt, in the
Gopher Range, surface cuts and shafts, of greater or less depth, made and sunk
in prospecting for copper, are of frequent occurrence. In fact, this is the same
belt that has been so often mentioned as “the second important copper-bearing
belt of Calaveras County,” and located some six or seven miles southwest of
the main copper belt of Copperopolis. The “importance” of this belt, on
account of the copper ores which it contains, has been most grossly exaggerated.
An amusing illustration of this fact is to be seen in a “map of the copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
mines in Calaveras County,” published a few years since, which represents the
whole region in question as literally covered for miles with highly colored
“locations” or “copper claims,” the whole of which, with few exceptions—and
these due not to copper but to gold—have served no further end than that of
rendering their locators and owners sadder and wiser men. At one locality,
indeed, viz, the “Napoleon Mine,” a body of copper ore was found which in
many countries would have been remunerative, and was worked to a considerable
extent; but the working here was attended only with loss, and was some
time since entirely discontinued. It should be remembered, however, in speaking
of the copper mines of California, that not only have they had to contend
with the general ignorance of copper mining, and especially of copper metallurgy
which has existed throughout the State, and with extremely high prices
for labor and transportation; but also that, for a year or two past, the largely
increased supply of ore from the mines of Chili in South America, and elsewhere—together
with the diminished demand and consequent low price for
metallic copper, reacting with increased effect upon the value of the ore—have
told with crushing weight even upon the best mines. There are certainly not
more than one or two, perhaps not even a single deposit of copper ore in the
known world, which surpasses or equals, in magnitude and intrinsic richness
combined, that of the “Union” Mine of Copperopolis; and yet it is said that
even the “Union” itself, which is the only mine now active at Copperopolis, is
hardly more than paying expenses at present rates. So far then as my observations
extend, there is simply nothing whatever in this “second copper belt”
which can for some time to come justify the expenditure of money in searching
for copper here; though it is not impossible that, besides the “Napoleon”
Mine, other deposits of ore may exist within the belt, which at some future
time, and under more favorable circumstances of labor, fuel, and transportation,
may become of value for the copper which they contain.</p>

<p>It has been already remarked that the zone or belt of surface decomposition
in which the “Quail Hill” and other similar mines occur, may be traced with
considerable constancy for at least fifteen or eighteen miles, and that it is not
improbable that it is much longer than this. We cannot, however, infer from
our present knowledge that the decomposed or “calico” rock is continuous
throughout the belt, or even for any considerable portion of its length. On the
contrary, its distribution within the belt appears capricious and local, <i>i.e.</i>, it
seems to occur in more or less detached and isolated masses, which vary largely
in form and size, and are irregular and indefinite in outline; so that little more
can be predicated of their occurrence in general, than that they are mostly
confined within a comparatively narrow belt, and that their longest dimension
exhibits a general tendency to approximate parallelism with the axis of the
belt, and the stratification of the inclosing country. Sometimes, as for instance,
along the northeastern side of the Quail Hill formation, this tendency is so
strongly developed, and the passage from the decomposed to the undecomposed
rock is so rapid, as to form for some little distance a tolerably straight and well
defined “wall” or line of demarcation, parallel, or nearly so, with the stratification
of the country. But the change or passage from the decomposed or “calico”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
rock to the surrounding undecomposed country, though sometimes rapid is
always gradual, so far as I have seen; and though we cannot yet speak much
from underground explorations, the surface appearances throughout the country
would indicate decidedly that so regular a line of demarcation as this at Quail
Hill is the exception, and not the rule. The southwestern limit of the decomposed
mass of Quail Hill has been found at several points; but here the change
from the decomposed to the undecomposed rock is not so rapid; and though
the explorations here, being shallow and limited, are insufficient to determine
this point with certainty, it is not probable that any such regularity of demarcation
exists here as upon the opposite side. Most of the “calico rock” of this
belt still retains distinctly the structure of the undecomposed rock from which
it was formed. The crystalline hornblendic rock is thus seen to have been
largely altered by the decomposing agency, and even the hornstone, which lay
in its track, seems to have been more or less affected by it. The decomposition
has been purely an oxidation, accompanied by such mechanical and chemical
changes as filtering mineral waters might produce. It is probably superficial,
both in origin and character, extending to no great depth, although the main
level at Quail Hill is nearly one hundred and twenty feet beneath the summit of
the hill, and the decomposition of most of the rock at this depth, so far as
exploration has gone, is as perfect as at any higher level. It is certainly long
subsequent in date to the metamorphism of the surrounding country, and is
unquestionably largely due to the action of the products of the oxidation of
metallic sulphurets (chiefly those of iron and copper) which were originally
distributed through the rock. At the same time it is not easy to account for
the whole of it in this way alone, since at certain localities undecomposed sulphurets
are seen near the surface, and in rock which is apparently much more
permeable to atmospheric influences than was much of that which has been
more deeply decomposed; and again, much of the decomposed rock, though
retaining well its original structure, shows far too little traces of sulphurets to
readily account for so general and thorough a decomposition as has taken place.
It is all indeed more or less colored by oxide of iron, but much of it is not
deeply colored, and the undecomposed hornblendic rock itself, in the absence of
all sulphurets, contains sufficient iron in the state of protoxide to impart a strong
coloring when the rock is decomposed and the iron passes to the state of sesquioxide.
Much of the iron originally present has undoubtedly been removed
in a soluble form, as sulphate, etc. But in rock which preserves its original
structure, as well as most of this does, pyrites, if originally present, would have
left traces of its existence in the form of casts or cavities in the decomposed
mass, which might or might not have been filled with ferric oxide or other
matter. In certain localities the decomposed rock is in fact filled with such
cavities, often cubical in form, attesting the former presence of large quantities
of disseminated sulphurets. But in other localities they are few and far between,
and here accordingly the decomposition can hardly be supposed to have been
due to the local presence of sulphurets alone.</p>

<p>The exact methods by which the general and local decomposition has been
effected, and those by which the rock was originally impregnated with metallic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
ores—as well as the manner in which certain substances, as barytes, now found
as sulphate, and true porphyry, now found as kaoline or lithomarge, have found
their present situation in the belt in question—all these would possess both
interest and importance in a high degree, could they be more definitely known.
Such questions, however, cannot be answered with certainty, and their discussion
here would lead us too far into the doubtful realm of chemical geology.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the agencies at work, it is evident that there is
nothing in all this to remind us of a true vein formation. It appears that the
zone in question is neither a vein, nor generally speaking a system of veins.
On the other hand, it possesses emphatically in general the characteristics of
what the Germans style an impregnation—an impregnation indeed which exhibits
a certain regularity as being mostly confined within a narrow zone, and stretching
through a considerable extent of country, but which within these limits
shows the greatest irregularity of form, and much variety of character. Veins
of quartz occur here and there within the belt; but they are not more frequent
here than elsewhere, and their occurrence has probably little or no direct connection
with the peculiar character of the belt itself. There is very little that
deserves the name of quartz at Quail Hill, though much of the surface rock is
pretty highly silicious in character.</p>

<p>The impregnation of the rock with metallic sulphurets, particularly with
sulphurets containing copper, has in certain localities been sufficiently powerful
and concentrated to assume, in greater or less degree, the characteristics of
segregated veins of limited extent. This has been the case at the Napoleon
mine, and also at Quail Hill, where there is, or was, a band of oxidized ores of
copper traversing the decomposed rock in a direction parallel with the general
stratification. This band consisted chiefly of the green and blue carbonates of
copper, mingled with ferruginous and earthy matter, and accompanied by
barytes. The last named mineral, so common a veinstone in other parts of the
world, but hitherto so rare in California, occurs here in considerable quantity.
Its form is granular compact, sometimes quite pure, but usually contaminated
and intermingled with other matters. Crystallized specimens of it have not
been found here to my knowledge. It is hardly probable that the barytes itself
contains either gold or silver; yet it certainly occurs here in the most intimate
contact with both, as I have seen respectable particles of gold in place upon
the immediate surface of compact specimens of barytes—and a sample of heavy
concentrated barytic sand from the tailings of the mill, of sufficient fineness to
pass through a sieve of one hundred holes to the linear inch, yielded to the
assay over eleven dollars per ton in gold and silver.</p>

<p>The thickness of the copper band varied from one to three or four feet. Its
outlines were indefinite, and its original characteristics of form, etc., much
obscured by the complete decomposition both of itself and the surrounding
rock. It was without doubt originally a segregated mass of sulphurets; and
though it seems now to have nearly or quite run out and disappeared, it may
be found to come in again as such, in depth, unaltered below the line of surface
decomposition.</p>

<p>Other bands of similar character may perhaps exist in the yet undeveloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
portions of the mine. But the great mass of decomposed material which forms
Quail Hill as a whole, retaining as it does to so great an extent the original
structure of the country rock from which it was formed, can in no proper sense
be called a vein; although its extent, when considered as a repository of the
precious metals, is something far transcending the size of ordinary veins.</p>

<p>The gold and silver of these formations which have recently attracted so much
attention, and have become the object of extensive mining operations at Quail
Hill, seem to be distributed at the latter place, to a greater or less extent,
throughout the whole mass of the decomposed rock. The surface earth of the
hill, also, everywhere contains gold, which may be discovered by washing it in
the pan; but this ceases to be the case on the hillsides as soon as the limits of
the decomposed rock are passed. Some of the gold, as stated by Prof. Silliman
in his communication to the California Academy, already referred to, is quite
coarse; but much of it is exceedingly fine and difficult to save in the mill. It
is a noticeable fact in the distribution of the precious metals at Quail Hill, that
the cupreous ores and the material in their vicinity have hitherto been found to
be always rich in gold and silver, and to contain chiefly, if not exclusively, the
coarsest gold.</p>

<p>The distribution of the gold at Quail Hill is not uniform, the more slaty and ferruginous
portion of the decomposed rock being generally the richest in ore, while
the compact porphyritic kaoline contains but traces of gold, if any, and some
of the other and more compact rock is comparatively poor. The original distribution
of the sulphurets here seems also to have followed approximately the
same law—the kaoline containing in general but little trace of their existence,
while the more slaty rock is often full of their cavities. Hematite, as well as
the hydrated sesquioxide of iron, occurs here in small quantities; and a curious
point in this connection is the fact that, while much of the best ore is very highly
charged with the hydrated sesquioxide, the hematite has been found hitherto to
contain little or no gold. The origin of the decomposed porphyry at Quail
Hill is a point of much interest, and it may be a question whether it is not the
remnant of an intrusive igneous dyke. The arguments in favor of this supposition
consist in the entire dissimilarity in character and structure between it and
the surrounding material, as well as in the rarity of porphyry in the region
round about. In fact, I have nowhere else in this portion of the country seen
anything deserving of the name, while the whole texture and appearance of this
mass at Quail Hill are precisely such as would have resulted from the decomposition
in place of a true feldspathic porphyry. But however strongly these
facts may seem to argue in favor of an igneous origin, it is not easy to reconcile
such a supposition with its mode of occurrence here. Other masses of similar
character may exist within the hill; but so far as existing developments have
cut or uncovered the one of which I speak, the indications are that it is irregular
in outline, quite limited in extent, and of approximate lenticular shape.
Moreover, in certain places, it seems to pass gradually into the eastern country
rock, without any distinct line of demarcation, the change in the texture of the
rock being even more gradual than the passage from the decomposed to undecomposed
material. At certain points, but a few feet from the eastern “wall,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
the kaoline is as perfectly porphyritic in its texture and appearance as in any
portion of the mass, while between the two is every grade of passage from the
one to the other—the country rock being neither distinctly porphyritic in texture,
nor chiefly feldspathic in composition. I am strongly inclined to think,
therefore, in spite of its peculiar and distinctive character, that this porphyritic
mass is but a local result of the metamorphism of sedimentary strata, which,
in many portions of this region, seems to have been as varied in character as it
has been high in degree.</p>

<p>The degradation of such formations as this at Quail Hill, has undoubtedly
furnished some of the placer gold of the region; but the evidence does not by
any means justify us in supposing that it has furnished the whole of it. Gopher
Gulch, which runs at the foot of Quail Hill, and its branches, for a mile above
this point, or nearly to the summit of the Gopher Range, and hundreds of feet
above the level of the Quail Hill formation, were in early days rich in placer
gold, much of which was very coarse. Other gulches in the vicinity have also
furnished more or less gold high up towards the summit of the range. Moreover,
the quartz veins, which here and there occur in the hard metamorphic
rock, are known, some of them at least, to contain gold, and such have probably
played their part in the formation of the placers.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the fact of the prominent association of the precious
metals with ores of copper at the Quail Hill mine; but this fact derives
still further interest from what follows. As far as my observations have extended
in Calaveras County, and also at Whisky Hill, in Placer County, wherever
gold and silver have yet been found in paying quantities in the decomposed rock
formation, there also, or close at hand, are found the oxidized ores of copper,
carbonates and silicates; and conversely, I have nowhere seen oxidized ores of
copper in this decomposed rock which were not, comparatively at least, rich in
gold and silver. It is true that sufficient developments have not yet been made
to enable us to state whether this is the general fact or not. It is possible that
the association of these ores may be to a certain extent accidental; but it is not
unlikely that it may be otherwise;—and at all events this is a point well worthy
of attention and further investigation.</p>

<p>As this finishes my remarks upon the “calico rock” formation. I will close
by simply mentioning a point relating to the lower country of Calaveras County,
that I have not yet seen publicly noticed elsewhere. The low, rolling hills
which form the eastern border of the San Joaquin plain between the Stanislaus
and Calaveras Rivers, contain extensive beds of horizontally stratified material,
which is probably sedimentary-volcanic in origin. The color of these beds is
usually varying shades of gray. They contain no pebbles, so far as I have
seen; they generally crumble easily, and resemble in appearance a friable sandstone.
But their grain or grit, which is pretty fine, is also quite clean and
sharp as well as hard, and rough-polishes rapidly the hardest steel when rubbed
upon it.</p>

<p>These beds are of considerable thickness, and cover many square miles of
country. Their stratification has evidently not been disturbed since they were
deposited, though they have been largely eroded. The frequent flat tops of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
hills, and the level benches, which these beds have produced along their sides,
by irregularities of wear, impart a peculiar aspect to the scenery.</p>

<h3>On the Occurrence of Glauberite at Borax Lake, California.</h3>

<p class="center">BY B. SILLIMAN.</p>

<p>Glauberite, a species not before recognised as occurring in North America
occurs at Borax Lake, where it has lately been obtained in blue clay, brought
up from a depth of forty feet by an artesian boring. No other crystallized,
species was detected in the masses of clay examined.</p>

<p>Glauberite is a sulphate of lime and soda, half an atom of each base in combination
with an atom of sulphuric acid. It is usually associated with rock
salt, as at Villa Rubia, in New Castile, and also at Ausee, in Bavaria, and in
the salt mines of Vic, in France. In the Atacama desert in Peru, it is associated
with a fibrous borate of lime called Hagesine. Mr. Stretch, the State
Mineralogist of Nevada, in his catalogue of minerals found in that State, mentions
borate of lime (Hagesine) as occurring in globular masses and in layers
from two to five inches thick, alternating with layers of salt in a salt marsh
in the Columbus mining District, Esmeralda County. It is quite possible that
a careful scrutiny would detect glauberite also in this association so analagous
to that of Atacama.</p>

<p>Reference was also made to the occurrence of the species laghassite detected
by Prof. S. in 1864, at the little Salt Lake near Rag Town in Nevada, as illustrating
in an interesting manner, the chemistry of these bodies of saline water.
The latter species is a hydrous, carbonate of lime and sodium, while glauberite
is a sulphate of the same bases. Both salts undoubtedly result from the reaction
of the respective elements pre-existing in solution in the saline waters.</p>

<p>The crystals of glauberite from Borax Lake occur in very thin flattened tables,
derived apparently from the great extension of the faces <i>O</i> of the Monactinic
prism.</p>

<h3>On the Scientific Name of the “Big Trees.”</h3>

<p class="center">BY H. G. BLOOMER, CURATOR OF BOTANY.</p>

<p>Early in 1853, specimens of the “Big Trees” were presented to this Academy;
Dr. Kellogg and other botanists, members of the Academy, at once pronounced
them to belong to the genus <i>Taxodium</i>, to which the common “Redwood”
of California was referred at that time. Endlicher’s work upon the
Coniferæ, in which the genus <i>Sequoia</i> (named after an Indian Chief) was instituted,
had not at that time reached us. Our California Redwood, <i>Taxodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
sempervirens</i> was included in the new genus of Endlicher. So then, the true
scientific position of the Big Trees was first determined by members of the
California Academy of Natural Sciences. At the time of the presentation of
these specimens, an English collector of plants and seeds, Mr. William Lobb,
saw them, and having experience enough to know that they belonged to a
species new to the gardeners, immediately started for the grove and obtained
cones, wood and foliage, which he carried with him to England in the fall of
1853. Dr. Lindley hastily described these as <i>Wellingtonia gigantea</i> in the
<i>Gardener’s Chronicle</i> for December 1853.</p>

<p>In the meantime Drs. Kellogg and Behr pursued their studies of the great
tree, and at length being convinced that there was no generic difference between
it and the <i>Taxodium sempervirens</i> (now <i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>) instituted the
species <i>Taxodium giganteum</i>, described in the Proceedings of the Cal. Acad.
Nat. Sciences, May 7th, 1855, Vol. I, page 53.</p>

<p>Previous to this, however, Seemann, in Bonplandia, 3, p. 27, January 15th,
1855, described it under the term of <i>Sequoia Wellingtonia</i>. Mr. Seemann
gives his reasons at length in the Magazine of Natural History, 3d Series, Vol.
3, p. 164, for discarding the genus <i>Wellingtonia</i> of Lindley, and says: “Dr.
Torrey was undoubtedly the first who determined the true systematic position
of the tree.” Now this is an error, for Dr. Torrey’s publication is dated in
August, 1855; whereas Drs. Kellogg and Behr’s appeared May 7th, 1855.</p>

<p>The principal thing to be determined in this matter now is, as to the name
and author, for these must accompany each other; shall it be:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Sequoia gigantea</i> Endlicher, May, 1847;</li>
<li><i>Wellingtonia gigantea</i> Lindley, December, 1853;</li>
<li><i>Sequoia Wellingtonia</i> Seemann, January 15th, 1855;</li>
<li><i>Taxodium giganteum</i> Kellogg and Behr, May 7th, 1855; or</li>
<li><i>Sequoia gigantea</i> Torrey, August, 1855?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of other names made use of and referred to by Seemann,
Murray and others; but as they come to us without the least scientific authority,
they ought not to be considered.</p>

<p>Dr. Lindley’s genus falls to the ground almost by common consent. I will
refer here to a communication from Prof. Brewer, late of the geological survey
of this State. Before he left San Francisco, he sent Dr. W. J. Hooker one of
the large photographs of the “Grizzly Giant,” one of the big trees in the
Mariposa grove; he had written to Prof. Brewer, asking about “the Wellingtonia,
Washingtonia, I care not what you call it.” In Prof. Brewer’s answer,
he told him that he (the Prof.) did care what he called it, and also that it was
not a new genus, but a <i>Sequoia</i>. Dr. Hooker, in his answer to this, says: “I
heartily agree with you in all you say about the big tree; it has now produced
good fruit in our gardens, and is as true a <i>Sequoia</i> as can be, and should have
no other name.” So here we have high authority for discarding Lindley’s
<i>Wellingtonia</i>. Yet this only settles the question as to the generic term; Dr.
Hooker’s opinion thus far has only given us <i>Sequoia</i>.</p>

<p>The next claimant in point of priority is Dr. Seemann, who rightly refers it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
<i>Sequoia</i>, and adds the specific term <i>Wellingtonia</i>, giving sufficient reasons for
discarding Endlicher’s specific term <i>gigantea</i>, as that was shown by Hooker to
be founded upon <i>Abies</i> (Picea) <i>bracteata</i>.</p>

<p>In recent publications of American botanists, we find the term <i>Sequoia
gigantea</i> of Torrey used to designate the species; to show that this is not the
true nomenclature, I need but to say that Dr. Torrey never described it at all
in any book or proceedings. The reference is to the American Journal of
Science and Art, Vol. 18, p. 286, August, 1855, where it says: “Dr. Torrey
made to the American Association for the Advancement of Science a communication
in reference to the Big Tree of California;” also Vol. 17, p. 443, but
no description. Now here is no sufficient ground for Dr. Torrey’s <i>Sequoia
gigantea</i>, for there is absolutely no description at all, but a mere reference; and
this reference is published three months after Drs. Kellogg and Behr have
described the tree as <i>Taxodium giganteum</i>.</p>

<p>I think now that Endlicher’s, Lindley’s, and Torrey’s claims have been refuted;
the controversy is narrowed down as between Seemann and Drs. Kellogg and
Behr. By strict usage, and without the usual courtesy of scientific men, the nomenclature
of the “Big Tree” should be <i>Sequoia Wellingtonia</i> of Seemann. But
if courtesy is to be shown at all, it should be to those students who are entitled
to it; that Drs. Kellogg and Behr are justly entitled to this honor, I cannot for
one moment doubt. Specimens of this gigantic tree were in their possession
many months before any other botanist had directed his attention to the subject;
studying indeed under every disadvantage, for our botanical literature at
that time was very meagre, not even Endlicher’s work on the Coniferæ, in which
was to be found the then newly instituted <i>Sequoia</i>, to which was referred our
common <i>Taxodium sempervirens</i> of Lambert, being available. Had they access
to this work they would have given us <i>Sequoia gigantea</i>; mark, that this was
three months before Torrey’s reference.</p>

<p>They therefore are in truth and reality, if not technically, the first scientific
discoverers of the true position of the great tree. The terms they used were
<i>Taxodium giganteum</i>, meaning by this that it was a congener with <i>Taxodium
sempervirens</i>, which it was.</p>

<p>If Seemann’s technical claims are set aside, then by courtesy <i>Sequoia gigantea</i>
Kellogg and Behr, ought to be written as the true name of the “Big Tree.”</p>

<p>For the advancement of science, we hope the final closing of this and other
questions pertaining to the Coniferæ of this coast will be left to the able
monographer of this order, Dr. George Engelmann, of St. Louis, who is now in
Europe, having the notes and observations of recent botanists, and who will
there have access to all the literature and material necessary to establish scientific
accuracy and unity in this important family of plants.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
